<!--
<h2> 1) What is a waitlist? </h2>
<p>
A waitlist is a list for people waiting to be registered. If a waitlist 
goes live, then we have hit our cap for this year's MBU, and cannot 
guarantee that you will be able to actually participate. However, we 
sometimes have extra space, and we would like to have as many scouts 
participate as possible. This waitlist allows us to collect all of the 
information we need to register you, without needing to ask you to pay. 
Scouts on the waitlist will be notified when the class lists are 
finalized if they will be able to participate in MBU.
</p><br>
-->

<!--
<h2> 2) Am I registered for the waitlist? </h2>
<p>
If you recieved a confirmation email saying that you were registered, 
and you registered after the waitlist was implemented, then yes, you are 
registered for the waitlist. If you tried to register and did not 
receive an email, please check your email's spam filters, or contact us. 
Do not try to register again until you hear from us, as this could cause 
duplicate registrations in the system.
<br>
<br>
Please note that the waitlist is now closed for the 2016 MBU. If you 
registered prior to 2/10/2016, and meet the above criteria, then you are 
all set. Any attempts at registering for the waitlist after 2/10/2016 
will not be processed.

<h2> 1) What is the WPI Merit Badge University? </h2>
<p>
The WPI Merit Badge University (MBU) is a two weekend long course where scouts have the opportunity to learn new skills and earn exciting Merit Badges. As this MBU is held on the WPI campus, we have access to many resources that enable us to offer cool and exciting STEM related badges.  The scouts are also introduced to the college environment, and some classes get to see up close the top-of-the-line labs and facilities here at WPI. 

This MBU is organized and run by the local Alpha Phi Omega Chapter at WPI, and the vast majority of our volunteers are students here on campus.
</p>
<h1>About Alpha Phi Omega</h1>
<p>
Alpha Phi Omega is an international co-ed service fraternity with active chapters on over 300 college campuses worldwide. The fraternity was founded in 1925 by Scouts who believed the ideals of scouting can make the world a better place. What started as an organization of men with scouting ties has since expanded to accept any college student willing to promote Alpha Phi Omega's mission and values. 
<br/><br/>Vision: To be recognized as the premier service-based leadership development organization
<br/>Mission: Prepare campus and community leaders through service
<br/>Values: Develop leadership, promote friendship, and provide service
<br/>Objectives: Share, Grow, Improve, and Invest
<br/><br/>Our chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, the Omicron Iota chapter, was founded in 1964 and has always had close ties with the local Boy Scouts. We frequently volunteer to do service projects at local scout camps, such as Camp Resolute and Treasure Valley, and have been organizing this MBU for the past few years.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 2) Why did the WPI MBU move to the fall? </h2>
<p>
We had multiple reasons for moving MBU to the fall: there are at 
least three other MBUs in the area in the spring that usually conflicted 
with ours, there have been issues with snow and other inclement weather, 
and there are fewer events on campus in the fall that could conflict 
with booking rooms for MBU.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 3) Will there still be an MBU in the spring? </h2>
<p>
No, the WPI MBU is permanently moving to the fall, and there will no 
longer be an MBU in the spring at WPI.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 4) I didn't get into a badge during one/two of the blocks. What 
happened? </h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, we have had many more scouts request certain badges than 
we can accomodate in those classes. Scouts who did not get into either 
of their top choices for a particular block will have a free period 
during that block. A room has been set aside for this purpose, and games 
will be provided.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 5) Can I change or add a badge to my schedule? </h2>
<p>
<strong>Please DO NOT send requests for badge changes over email</strong>. 
All badge change requests will be handled through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfbNIXSmtBra0qw4kCM4VxpJfiNxR3XRxwsjRnLGAghb-HeA/closedform" target="_blank"> this form</a>. 
Badge change confirmations will be emailed out every Sunday. 
Please note that requesting a change does NOT guarantee the change will be made. 
The deadline for badge change requests is October 29th. Due to the volume of scouts
 attending we will not be handling badge change requests during the days of MBU, please plan accordingly.
</p>

<h2> 6) Your payment site is broken/I got an error message while trying 
to pay. </h2>
<p>
If our payment site claims that you are to be charged $0, you do 
<b>NOT</b> need to pay! Our payment site does not handle charging $0 
well, and will return an error if you submit credit card information. Do 
not worry; your information is not recorded by our system in the event 
of an error. <!-- We will not take payment from scouts who are on the 
waitlist, as we cannot guarantee that you will be able to participate in 
MBU. If you are told that you have been accepted into classes, and were 
registered on the waitlist, please bring your payment to the first day 
of MBU, and turn it in at the Registration Table.
-->
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 7) When will I hear which merit badges I am taking? </h2>
<p>
We will be emailing all scouts with the list of badges they will be 
taking in early October, when we finalize the class lists. <!-- At this 
time, scouts on the waitlist will learn if they are able to participate 
in MBU. Scouts who are not accepted off of the waitlist will also 
receive emails notifying them.
-->
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 8) How can I receive information about future MBUs? </h2>
<p>
We are now maintaining a mailing list for all scouts that want to know 
more about future MBUs. Please fill out this Google Form <a 
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepS1anTxdFnrCWAG5R1Bac_v35ulysDNgzgHvXwAhAF-pVzw/viewform?c=0&w=1">survey</a> to be added to the 
list. You will need to fill out this survey after each MBU, as it will 
be purged yearly to avoid sending unnecessary emails. Those on the list 
will be notified prior to a purge.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 9) I'm not from the Mohegan Counicl, can I still attend? </h2>
<p>
Of course! Scouts from any council are welcome, no matter how far away you are. Everyone registers the same way, so the only difference is how you might receive your blue cards. (Some councils accept electronic blue cards, while some only accept the traditional paper ones)
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 10) Are scouts required to attend both dates in order to earn a badge?
</h2>
<p>
Yes, scouts must attend both dates to complete a badge. There are NO single-date
badges offered.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h2> 11) I have a question that isn't listed here. What should I do?
</h2>
<p>
Please contact us at <a href="mailto:mbu@wpi.edu">mbu@wpi.edu</a>, and
we will respond as soon as we are able. Please note that we are all
student volunteers, and we ask that you respect our decision to keep our
education a priority. We will get back to you as soon as we are able.
