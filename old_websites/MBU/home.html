<p>
This year’s Merit Badge University will be 9:00 AM - 4:10 PM October 29th and 
November 12th 2016. It will be held at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Check in will 
be 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM October 29th in the Lower Fuller Laboratory Lounge. 
</p>
<p>
Parents should drop their Scouts off in the Boynton Street Parking 
Lot, which has direct access to Fuller Laboratory. Brothers will be 
directing Scouts after they are dropped off. Due to another event on campus, 
on-campus parking will not be available, and off-campus parking will be 
limited. If you would like to stay for the day, please contact <a 
href="mailto:parking-mbu@wpi.edu">parking-mbu@wpi.edu</a> to request a 
parking spot.
</p>
<p>
Every Scout will be able to attend up to 3 merit badge classes and lunch is 
included. The merit badge classes will run 9:00 - 11:00 AM, 12:00 - 
2:00 PM, and 2:10 - 4:10 PM. Scouts must attend both days, or they will 
only receive a partial Blue Card. Lunch will be 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM. 
The cost will be $15 per Scout. In order to get a refund, you must 
cancel one week prior to the first week of MBU.
</p>
<p>
This year, we will be using an electronic Blue Card processing system. Most 
Scouts will not need to provide Blue Cards. Instead, they will need their 
Scoutmasters to sign a "permission to persue" form (<strong><a 
href="MBU_Scoutmaster_Form.pdf">here</a></strong>) that will need to be 
turned in at registration on the first day. This system has only been 
approved for Scouts in the Mohegan and Knox Trail Councils. Scouts 
outside of these Councils will need to turn in signed Blue Cards at 
registration on the first day. All Scouts will receive their physical 
Blue Cards after the end of the third class on the second day.
</p>
<p>
All Scouts should be dressed in Class A or Class B uniforms. There will 
be another event on campus that day for middle school to high school 
aged students, and we need to have a way to distiguish Scouts from those 
students. Additionally, all Scouts will be directed between buildings by 
brothers of Alpha Phi Omega.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about MBU, please email <a 
href="mailto:mbu@wpi.edu">mbu@wpi.edu</a>. Please allow time for 
responses, as all of the organizers of this event are student 
volunteers. We are all students first, and we ask 
that you respect our decision to keep our education a priority. We will 
respond to all questions as quickly as time permits.
</p>

<p>
We would also appreciate any help from Volunteers and Scouters to assist 
teaching and sitting in on badges. If you would like to assist, please email 
<a href="mailto:mbu@wpi.edu">mbu@wpi.edu</a> with your name,
 troop number, council, and a copy of your Youth Protection Certificate 
available at MyScouting.org as well as the badge(s) you would be interested 
in assisting.
</p>
<p>
We thank you for your continued service to Scouting and helping the 
brothers of Alpha Phi Omega, Omicron Iota, host Merit Badge University here 
at WPI.<br>
