<h1>We apologize, but registration for MBU is now CLOSED!</h1> -->

<!--
<p> Registration is now open! Registration will be closed on October 1st or when
we reach 200 registered scouts, whichever comes first. There will <strong>NOT</strong> be a waitlist this year.
</p>

<p>
Walk-in registrations will <strong>NOT</strong> be accepted. All scouts
must register and receive notification from us that they have
been assigned to classes prior to the first day of MBU in order to participate. We will notify
everyone who registers of their badge assignments after registration closes.
</p>

<!-- UNCOMMENT THIS WHEN USING A WAITLIST -->
<!-- 
<p>
We do expect to have some extra space available, and are opening a 
waitlist. If you would like to sign up for this waitlist, please click 
<strong><a 
href=INSERT URL HERE>HERE</a></strong>. 
The waitlist will be first come, first served, by badge preference, and 
we do not guarantee any placements. Once you have submitted the form, 
you will be redirected to a WPI payment site that asks for your credit 
card information. <strong>You will not be able to complete this 
form.</strong> You may close your browser without filling in any payment 
information. Thank you for your interest in MBU.
</p>


<p>
We apologize to any scouts who were unable to register for our 
MBU, but at this time, we are not accepting any further registrations, 
and the waitlist is now full. However, please consider these other 
Merit Badge Universities that will also be running in the spring, and 
may still have room:<br>
-UMass Amherst MBU, hosted by Alpha Phi Omega - Kappa Omicron 
Chapter<br>
-Spirit of Adventure Council MBU<br>
-Old Colony Council MBU<br>
</p>

<p>
Walk-in registrations will <strong>NOT</strong> be accepted. All scouts 
must receive notification from us prior to the first day that they have 
been assigned to classes in order to participate in MBU. We will notify 
everyone on the waitlist as to whether or not they have been assigned to 
classes soon.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about what it means to be on a waitlist, 
please check our <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a> or contact <a 
href="mailto:mbu@wpi.edu">mbu@wpi.edu</a>. Please  
allow time for responses, as all of the organizers of this event are 
student volunteers. We are all students first, 
and we ask that your respect our decision to keep our education the 
priority. We will respond to all questions as quickly as time permits.
</p>

<p>We would also still appreciate any help from Volunteers and Scouters to assist 
teaching and sitting in on badges. If you would like to assist, please email 
<a href="mailto:mbu@wpi.edu">mbu@wpi.edu</a> with your name, troop number, 
council, and a copy of your Youth Protection Certificate available at 
MyScouting.org as well as the badge(s) you would be interested in assisting.

<!--<p>We have re-assessed our capabilities, and will be re-opening registration from now until the event. -->

<!--<p>Registration is now closed</p>-->

<!--
<p>Due to the overwhelming response from the scouting community, we 
have reached capacity for the event. Unfortunately we are not able to expand 
the program any further this spring and cannot admit any more scouts. Thank 
you for your interest, and check back in December for information on next 
year’s program.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there will <strong>NOT</strong> be a waitlist this year.</p>
