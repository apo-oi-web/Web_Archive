<p><img src="img/img/photoalbum/APO1.jpg" width= "350px" class="photo1"></img>
Omicron Iota is Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Alpha Phi Omega chapter. We are a strong chapter of entusiastic and active brothers. We were founded on December 18, 1964 just 39 years after the founding of Alpha Phi Omega. We are part of Region 1 <a href="http://www.apo96.org/index.shtml"> Section 96.</a> Our chapter is the largest organization on campus, and we have a recruitment period two times every year in which we allow prospectives to try to pledge and become brothers. Our members are known as OI-sters, and we have a strong dedication to service, leadership, and brotherhood.
