As a chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, Omicron Iota participates in a wide
variety of community service benefitting our brotherhood, our campus,
and our community. Each member is required to complete at least 20
hours of community service each semester. In order to organize service
events, our chapter has a Service Vice President and two supporting
service chairs, all of whom are vital in scheduling and supervising service
events.
</p>

While different service opportunities are always being discovered, we
have worked closely with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity,
Community Harvest Project, Mustard Seed Soup Kitchen, Wachusett
Greenways, Audubon Society, Tower Hill Botanical Garden, and Relay for
Life.

Every year, Omicron Iota hosts four service events that brothers are
required to attend. These event not only help serve others, but also
promote unity in the brotherhood.
</p>

<p>
Before the beginning of A-term, our service event is Freshman Move-in
Day. As implied by the name, we help welcome freshman to WPI by
helping them move furniture and belongings into their dorms, greatly
easing the strain on new students and their parents. The B-term event
is our Service Auction. For this event we auction off donated items
and services in order to raise money for the charity organization
chosen by the doner of the highest-earning item.
</p>

<p>
The C-term event is U.M.O.C. Standing for U.G.L.Y (Understanding,
Generous, Loyal, and Youthful) Man on Campus, this event involves
volunteers raising funds for a charity of their choice and then
competing in a pageant style competition. All of the money raised
is given to the winning team's chosen charity.
</p>

<p>
Merit Badge University is the D-Term annual service event, where we instruct
Boy Scout merit badge classes over the course of two weekends. This
event allows around 300 scouts from the Worcester area to earn up to
three merit badges, greatly helping them on their path to becoming Eagle
Scouts.
