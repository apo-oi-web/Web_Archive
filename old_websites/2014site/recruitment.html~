Our chapter has two recruitment periods per academic year. During
this time we ask that prospectives attend different events designed to
get them a taste of what APO and our chapter have to offer. During the
recruitment period perspectives are expected to attend an information
session, fellowships, service events, and at least one brother
meeting. Hopefully these events will help interested students in
deciding whether or not the fraternity is right for them.

At the end of recruitment, bids will be given to
those who have shown interest in joining Alpha Phi Omega. Once the bid
has been accepted they will begin the pledging period where they will
fulfill their requirements, and get to meet the brotherhood. Each
pledge gets a "Big" who will guide and help them through pledging.
