<li>What information does this website collect and when?
<p>
This website does not collect any personal information from

Facebook. These images are uploaded by brothers, pledges, and/or
prospective pledges, of Omicron Iota and tagged to a Facebook account
controlled by Omicron Iota. This website obtains permission from this
account to download this content without logging into Facebook. It is
possible for users to log into Facebook and register their accounts

whatsoever.

Images on this website feature brothers, pledges, and prospective
pledges of Omicron Iota. On occasion, they may also feature

information to pull this content from Facebook, which is obfuscated
within a java applet.

We do not use cookies, but we may in the future use client-side
cookies a yet-to-be-foreseen purpose. We will modify this policy when
that happens.
