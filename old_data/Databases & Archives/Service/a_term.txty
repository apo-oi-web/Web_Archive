Hey guys!!!

I hope that you are all having a great summer and that at least some of you get 
this message before school starts.....I have a list of activities that I am 
thinking about/planning for a-term some of which I just want you to be aware of 
and others that I would like some assistance on.  On any of the items below that 
have comments on helping out, if you would like to help out just email me about 
it to the address I am writing from (david@tbristol.com) or send it to me at 
school (smiles@wpi.edu).

*** Freshman movein - I will send out an email and/or call everyone who signed 
up but if anyone else is interested as well please feal free to email me!

*** Working with habitat for Humanity - I need to find out who the current 
contact is for the Worcester chapter and what they are up to this fall.  If 
someone can find out by going to the HFH office in the church at the corner of 
Park ave and Salisbury I would greatly appreciate it.  The office is near the 
door by the playground around the back side of the church(away from the road in 
the middle of the parking lot!)

*** Doing a car wash to benefit Habitat or another worthy cause...These are 
always fun in my opinion and if we do it early in the term it should be nice and 
warm so it should be a blast...I need someone to find out the info from above, 
so if one person does this please email me so I can tell the person doing this 
:)  I also need someone to talk to the church and see if they would be willing 
to have the car wash on their property....if someone wants to get the info for 
this activity and the one above that would be great.


*** Apple picking and making apple related food for a shelter or retirement 
home....Here I would need someone to find out a good apple
orchard...Sarah may 
already know of one...and find a good place to take the food we make 
too....Everyone be thinking of your favorite recipes to make the apples into.

*** Working with SNAP to provide alcohol free entertainment on the 
weekends....This is a tall order and I have lots of ideas but nothing concrete 
yet.  If you have ANYTHING that you would like to contribute on this idea, 
please do so cause I think that this could be pretty cool but I am not sure how 
exactly to go about it...The first thought I had was to have concerts of school 
bands on the quad (or indoors when it is too cold etc) and stuff like that.

*** An end of the term concert as a study break and charity fundraiser.  I am 
thinking of calling this concert "Cool-Aid" and getting a fairly big band to 
play....There would be refreshments and so forth and the admission would be low 
but enough to raise money for a charity we decide on ....This could be really 
cool but we need the support of the whole chapter and probably Ray and Denice to 
wear disco clothing again ;)

*** Organ donation education programs and others like it, when Amy comes back 
from Co-Op

*** Mustard Seed (of course)

*** I have more ideas to come but I don't want to spoil all of the surprises!!

Well that about wraps it up for now,  I hope that you are all having a great 
summer.....Hopefully I will see most of you at Freshman movein and If not by the 
first APO brother's meeting
