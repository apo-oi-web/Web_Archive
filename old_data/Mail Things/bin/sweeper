 This program assists in file organization and clean-up. Sweeper 3.0 now will
 begin execution in you home directory, thus alleviatin' concerns of sweepin'
 the wrong directory. Sweeper will remove the followin' files.

     Any files marked with a tilde(~).
     Any files enclosed in number signs(#)
     Any files that are named dead.letter or dead.article.
     Any files that are named *.out (executables)
     Any files that are names *.o (object files)
     Any files that are named core.
     Any files that are names .nfs*.

 The speed has been increased through the use of a stream-lined and customized
 format, by deleting the files that are most commonly encountered. This should
 improve the overall speed and execution. I've almost replaced all echo's with
 a personal C code, which is a little faster. The overall speed change will be
 most apparent in a 'slow' system.
