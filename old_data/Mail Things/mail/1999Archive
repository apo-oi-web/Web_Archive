	I am sending this email in regard to the nomiation for President
of Alpha Phi Omega, Omicron Iota chapter. I would like to nominate Jimmy
Carson Cook for the position. Already having served as the Spring '99
Pledge Class President, I believe that Jimmy has an acceptable amount of
experience with the Alpha Phi Omega Brotherhood, the ideals held by Alpha
Phi Omega, and the responsibilities that come with such a position. As
someone who has worked closely with Jimmy as the Pledge Class Secretary, I
believe that I am in an appropriate position to nomiate him for President
of APO. Because Jimmmy is relatively new in APO, he is not involved in any
of the poor politics which have become such an apparent problem in the
executive branch of APO. He is a new, socially unincumbered personality
who will be able to stay on track without getting distracted by futile
details. There are no personal issues which could make him lose focus of
APO, it's goals, and it's brotherhood. Also an active brother of Phi Sigma
Kappa, Jimmy is not only familiar with the protocol in such an
organization, but also has gained connections around campus and throughout
different organizations. I believe it is important to have a president who
is familiar with the Greek community on campus, so that we can work with
the other organizations in service to become that much stronger and
improve APO's image on campus and in the community. Jimmy Carson Cook is
an individual with the qualities one needs to hold such a position. He
lives the values held by APO - an excellent example for brothers and
pledges alike. His focus, unbiased persona, and ability to work with
people all work together to make him a very strong candidate for
Presidency of Alpha Phi Omega, Omicron Iota chapter.
Thank you for your time, 
Kate Manning

	I would also like to give a nomination for Jimmy Cook.  Though
there are several reasons why I and many others feel Jimmy would do an
excellent job, I will give the most important reason.  Jimmy proved his
ability to serve as president as he was the pledge class president. I
realize serving as the president of the entire fraternity is a much
greater responsibility, I am sure Jimmy can handle this.  In the word
capable I refer to many things.  He is capable of keeping patience and 
listening to the group as a whole.  He is capable of learning what he
does not know and admitting to the things he does not know.  He can calm
a group with all seriourness or break them into laughter.  He knows how
far to take a joke and when it is out of line.  He has the will to find
the potential of APO and bring it out in all of us.  He can make you
smile or shut you up, he is brief and to the point, and he is competent
to hold a role of authority.
	Jimmy is not the person in our fraternity who knows the most about
it's history or the most about the laws.  Though Jimmy is someone who will
learn and commit to whatever is asked of him. This is something he wants
to do, not any of us are throwing upon him. We need a change and I know he
is the change we require.  I believe he is the best choice for our pledge
class president. 

Thank you, Katie Gagnon

I would like to nominate Jimmy Cook for the position of President.  I think
that he has fresh ideas and a less jaded outlook on what should be done
within execcom.  Quite simply i think he would go out of his way to protect
the interest of the brothers and because of this he would be a fantastic
choice.  He has experience and the potential to be a great motivator and
leader.

 I hope he gets the chance to prove it.

  As a brother of Alpha Phi Omega I would like to nominated Jason Hudson
for the role of President.  I feel that he has the insiration and
leadership skills necessary for this job.  Also, he has the heart for the
priciples of the organization and would lead the brotherhood and uncomming
pledges into a mode of service, leadership, and friendship.

Thank You

I agree with Fred, just to make sure, members should be reminded of and
encouraged to exercise their right to attend excomm, so they feel better
about this decision. 

Also, members may or may not know who has access to the APO account, and
they might forget, so please, sign the emails with your name if you use
that account. Clear communication is important to maintaining the trust of
the membership, in my humble opinion.  :)

Have a happy Tuesday,

I agree - MUST MUST MUST sign emails - people keep asking me questions
about it and I ain't the one who wrote them so unfortunatly I aint got no
answers!  

Also, a sid enote, it was brought up to me, after the meeting so I was a
little anoid since it could have been fixed during the meeting - but,
missy - you forgot to mention that the vote would also automatically
update the bylaws to say whatever new number we voted upon.  Until that is
changed, the dues are still 40$ and since they weren't aware that the vote
would change the bylaws we can't just change them.  I personally don't
think people will change their vote if we tell them that it would change
the bylaws, but we did make a big stink that we wanted to follow them to a
"T" when selecting the procedures to find a new pres, the least we should
do is the same for the dues...  

just me and my $.02!

sorry about not signing all of my emails from apo.  some of them, i
thought, were from execomm, not just myself.  those are the ones that i
have not been signing, because the emails & their contents were agreed
upon by execomm.  i just didn't know if it might come across as just my
emails.........and that was certainly not the case.  but i will sign them
from now on.........

hmmmm......didn't we say that this was a change to the by-laws when we
announced that we were going to be discussing it 2 weeks ago???  and i
think when jon wrote on the board the numbers we had for the votes nila (i
think it was you) said that it was a change to the by-laws so we needed a 2/3
vote.  i will put it in my email about absentee voting (fred- i need those
figures for that!!)

Hi, 

	I was wondering what the outcome of the dues increase vote was.
It has since come to my attention that the $40 is in our bylaws, so
doesn't that mean that 3/4 vote is required?  Also, I now have information
that a $10 increase is not necessary, and the fact that other chapters pay
more is not truly a sufficient reason to justify an increase of that
amount.  I realize that I did vote yes yesterda, but is there any way that
I can reconsider my vote?

. Actually ... the funny thing about that ... well ... it's a 3/4 vote.  

. Also, I don't think those numbers were right on the vote for the people
at yesterday's meeting.  If I recall, we calculated the number of YES votes
by taking the total number of people there, and then subtracting the number
of NO and ABSTAINs.  But for NO, we counted 3 and ABSTAIN we coulded 2.  

. I know that there were more than three people who voted NO. 

. Additionally, I do not believe that there were 53 people present at the
time of that vote (people came in and people left)

. Sorry, I've been away from my computer pretty much all last night and all
today.

. Either way, it's really messy to try and present the figures in the Excel
worksheet.

. My suggestion?  Give these figures

Cost per brother (size of 60)	: $45.53
Income per brother				: $44.17
Net total						: -$1.36

. And you can also leave a note that I can give them the full figures or
even e-mail them the PowerPoint presentation if they wish, but for the sake
of brevity and cleaness of presentation, that's probably the easiest way.

. Is it really a non-abstension vote?  Doesn't say explicitly, but then
again, it might be implicit.  I don't know these things too well.

. But to address Missy's point, there were definitely more than three as I
know four and am pretty sure about the fifth (Nila?)

Hello Brothers!
  It has been a while since I've shown my 'face', but I thought that this
was as good a time as ever.
  This may be a long email, but I hope it will be worthwhile.
  Let me begin by personally thanking every one of the Brothers that went
to the Great Retreat!  This was a wonderful time, I think all that went
will agree!  It was not only an escape from the work and stress from the
Tech Hill for a while... it was a time for Leadership, Friendship, and
Service. 
  This was an excellent example of what APO is all about.  We came
together, many of us forgoing other important issues in our lives, to
spend time together as a brotherhood in Friendship and Service. (Some were
not able to do so, and this is understandable!) We spent time with our
Brothers as friends, making new friends and rekindling old friendships.
We worked together as a group, in Cheerful Service.  We re-dedicated our
vows to the Brotherhood.  I think all will agree that this was a wonderful
experience for all!  The turnout was quite good, too!  And how fitting
that the weekend we shared together was the weekend of the New Moon!
  Even after this event was over, the feeling of goodness is great.. 
Brothers smiling at Brothers in passing and reflecting on the wonderful
games of Chess, Risk, Trivial Pursuit, cards, Ultimate, (nude swimming?),
and the weekend as a whole. Everything about this weekend, from the skits
(push it in, pull it out, twirl it all around, hey!...) *snicker* to the
smores, and the SNORES, to the service, and all the other activities
helped bring those involved together. 
  I hope we can all continue these high spirits... and have this general
good feeling spread throughout the brotherhood... even to those who were
not present!  High spirits can help us through these hard times that we're
going through right now... A very important thing is that we stay together
as a Brotherhood and work toward higher goals.
This brings me to my next topic... the difficulties we're having as a
brotherhood.  It is quite apparent that All Is Not Well in the OI chapter.
HOWEVER, I do believe this situation can be rectified.  AND, I do believe
that we all hope the situation can be improved.  AND, I believe that if we
work together, as a Brotherhood, we can improve the situation we are in 
and the general feeling of frustration.
  One major area of dissent at this time is our need for a new President.
This is a major area of conflict and frustration.  Let us work TOGETHER in
pursuit of our goal for establishing a new President quickly,
efficiently, and in a manner that will allow all views to be voiced.
The executive committee has decided on the way that the new President be
chosen.  The Executive Committee will choose a new President under the
direction of Marilyn Mims.
  This may not be the MOST IDEAL way to choose a President, nor is it the
way we USUALLY choose a President.  ExeComm and the Brotherhood both agree
on this matter.  Still, we need an effective, efficient way of choosing a
new President.  A general body vote is a long process that cannot be taken
lightly nor underestimated in the amount of time and effort it will
require.  Under the circumstances, an ExeComm vote was deemed to be a good
way, and THE way, that this election will be run.  In the meeting last
night, several Brothers expressed their concern about this method.  It was
good that we all had an opportunity to voice our opinions. That being
said, I think it is time that we accept this decision and support this
method of election.
  Let us voice our opinion of who we feel would be a good candidate by way
of an email to apo@wpi.edu and express why we would like our candidate to
be President.  This is your vote: let your voice be heard!  We must stand
behind the decision of the Executive Committee.  Show your support by your
email nomination!
  I hope you are all still with me.  I sincerely thank you for reading
this. I hope I did not anger anyone by this email. If I did, it was
certainly not my intent!  Please email apoelf@wpi.edu alone to express any
concerns, comments or disapproval of anything said!
  I wish you all a good evening!  Be heard: nominate!

	Always in Leadership, Friendship, and Service,

		The OI Elf

I nominate Vishnu Pandey to serve as President.  From what I have seen he
is active in the chapter and has experience being in a leadership
position, so I feel that he would make a good candidate.

Brothers,

	Monday night, as was announced two weeks ago, we had a discussion
and vote concerning a by-law amendment, a dues increase.  For all of you
brothers that were not able to make it to tonight's meeting (please
include your reasons for not attending) what will follow is a overview of
the presentation concerning the dues raise.  Please have your votes
emailed to apo@wpi.edu no later than Sunday, September 19 at noon (yes, no
or abstain).  Thank you.

  First discussed was the basic breakdown of pledge cost.  The money
collected in pledge dues ($40) covers only National costs ($35), their
service pin (3.50) & the left over money ($1.50) goes toward the cost of
the composite.  This leaves a total of approximately $5 per brother in 
order to cover the remaining cost of composites for the pledges, thus
raising the per brother cost of composities to approximately $16.  
Pledging costs like folders, shirts, nametags are not covered by the
pledge dues.  These are paid for by the brotherhood.
  
  Next discussed was the breakdown of what the brother dues go towards,
our current income and finally a proposed income including the dues raise.
The basic figures for this are as follows:

Cost per brother (size of 60)   : $45.53
Income per brother              : $44.17
Net total per brother           : -$1.36
Net defiecit			: -$81.60

  These figures (and all figures discussed in the meeting) pertained only
to previous years and therefore programs and activities which were in
place at that time.  Retention, the formal, retreats and the awards
banquet are new programs and therefore are not covered by these figures.
Additionally, Fellowship does not recieve a budget under these figures,
except for money specifically and exclusively for senior gifts.  As you
can see, without any of these programs, we already have a negative amount
of money to work with.

  If you would like to see the entire Power Point presentation and/or see
the rest of the figures, please email either Fred (prion@) or the apo
account (apo@).  
  Thank you.


	Melissa

I vote yes, and I could not attend the meeting because I was in class.

Also, I seem to remember pledge dues going up last year (assuming it went
through to incrase them); not sure if that was taken into account in the
figures listed, assuming it even passed sinc eI don't remember.

Assuming I'm understanding this correctly: raising dues from $40 to $50, right?

Then I vote YES

Dear Brothers,

Have you ever been asked to give a workshop at a conference and not known
where to start with your preparation?  Have you ever put hours of work into
preparing a workshop that will only be given once or twice?

The National Leadership Development Committee has come with a solution for
both situations.  The Leadership Resources Clearinghouse is a web site
<http://www.concord.edu/~apo/leadres/leadres.html> which contains notes and
handouts from a variety of workshops as well as general information sheets
on the same topics.  The collection is intended as a resource from which
APO Brothers can prepare workshops.  This intent is similar to that of the
modular seminars still distributed in the Section Resource Manual.  It
provides a background which the presenter must then adapt to the audience.
It is not intended to provide a "canned" workshop ready for someone to
present.

As region conference season is drawing near many of you who have been asked
to give workshops at the conferences will be able to draw upon this
resource immediately.  Conference chairs please be sure to let your
presenters this resource is available for their use.

When you visit the site you will notice the authors of the workshops tend
to represent a limited portion of the fraternity.  The LD committee wants
you to use this resource.  However, the Clearinghouse is just starting out.
It needs to be expanded.  That is the primary purpose of this message to
urge you to share the notes and handouts of workshops you have previously
presented by sending them in for inclusion in the Clearinghouse.  You can
send them by replying to this message and simply attaching electronic
versions of the materials or you can mail them to me at the address below.
Any format is fine.  I can convert just about anything to pdf.  I have only
had trouble with some older Mac files.  As caretaker of this site, I
promise to get your work up promptly and ensure that each author gets full
credit.

Just to clarify do not send your workshop materials to the National Office.
 They will only have to spend the postage to send it on to me.  Send them
directly to me at rock@citlink.net or through the mail at the address
below.  This site has been developed by the National Leadership Development
Committee.

Here is a chance for you to be a part of a national effort to improve the
quality of workshops presented at conferences by allowing us to build on
one and others' efforts.  I hope you will participate in this effort by
sending in your workshop materials.

If you have any questions, I will be glad to hear from you as well.

I will now sit back and wait for my in-box to explode with workshop notes.
Thanks!


In Brotherhood,
Chris

Jimmy Cook expressed his interest to me in being the new president until
the elections next term and I feel that he would make an excellent
president.  I have known him since our first day at W.P.I and was one of
his best friends freshman year, so I feel I can vouch for his dedication
to a job.  I think he did an excellent job as APO pledge president, as I
did attend almost all the pledge meetings.  He is not afraid to get things
done if they need to be. And most importantly is a good person. Although
he was just initiated into APO, he is already a junior and mature enough
to handle this position.
	He is an Eagle Scout and a very hard worker.  If he was president,
I would feel very confident that things under him would be run as
smoothly as possible, which is one thing this fraternity needs.
If we were to have a general vote for a new president, he would be my
choice without fail.

					Thank you,
					Jenn Brandl

I think that HUDSON is the man for the job.  For the time that he has been
a member of APO, he has been active and enthusiastic and voices opinions
and ideas when needed.  So here is my nomination, short and sweet.

While bunkering down against impending death a' la' hurricane Floyd, I
decided to start cleaning for my move in 15 days.  While I had wonderful
intentinons (pack whole house), I only actually threw away two bags of
trash, and resorted to watching HBO.  I did however find the following.  It
was written by a Psi Omega brother a few years back.  I am not sure how I
ended up with it, but I decided to share it with all of you.

What is a Brother?
A brother is a helping hand when a load becomes too heavy.
A brother is a friend when it seems like no others care.
A brother is a shoulder to cry on when the world throws you a bad card.
A brother is there to do things for you when all the rest of the world runs
away.
A brother is someone who will love you and stand by you when everyone is
throwing stones and mocking you.
A brother is someone to admire, and someone who gives selflessly to those
around him, even those that he does not know.
A brother is proud and confident and never boasts himself by humiliating
others.
A brother is a gift sent from God, and one that should be cherished with all
we have, body and soul.

In L,F,&S,

Okay... thank goodnes... hurricane floyd has decided to be light on us :).
So.. you know what that means... we can have our rush fellowhship event
outside!!  Woohoo!  So.. I say we can play a great game of sardines or red
rover... whatever you guys prefer!  Of course, a name game before this will
be necessary so we can get to the rushers.  I was going to organize
dogdeball but that was only if the whether was crappy.. but it is supposed
to be REALLY NICE out. So save those indoor fun stuff for winter... enjoy
the outdoors while we still can :).

So details...
When:  Saturday, Sept. 18th
Time:	 6pm
Where: Meet in Wedge.

Brothers I encourage you all to attend.. even if you can stay only a half
hour or something.. I dont care... I just want to see you there!  Show the
rushers what a cool group we can be!

OH, jen H.  can ya forward this to the rushers so they know what is going
on???!!?

Thanks, Colleen

	Okay, I sent a message about a week ago announcing conclave.  With
the registration deadline quickly approaching, we're going to start
collecting money.  Again conclave is at the University of New Hampshire,
Nov. 5th-7th, registration is $35 or $40 is you want a t-shirt.  This
includes saturday night in a nice hotel right near all the outlet stores in
Kittery Maine!!!

	If you have any questions let me know, and I'll answer them.  Please
if you can, bring money to the meeting on Monday. It makes collection
easier!  
	Checks can be made out to Alpha Phi Omega, Theta Zeta Chapter.

	Last Conclave we won pledge mile, we almost had man mile.....  This
time maybe we can get all 3, (yes even roll call!)

	ok.......i think i found the source of our confusion...the 2 votes
in question.......they raised their hands for abstain.  They have stated
that they thought they were voting no, but they raised their hands for
abstain.  Now, both no & abstain votes count against yes ones, so the
only difference between the 2 is for recording purposes.  both abstain &
no serve the same purpose in terms of how they affect the vote.  but
anyway, that's what has messed us all up i think.

Hey, Everybody, 

	Don't forget that Monday after the APO meeting, we will have slide
show #2!  So if you are willing to stay after the meeting for a little
while to enact the slides to show prospective pledges what we're all
about, that would be great!!  See you Monday!

Yeah...I told Jon and Katie before the meeting as well.  I had a huge
project due the next day and Sunday night I had to trash a whole week's
worth of work and start over from scratch.  I just didn't have the
time...as it was I didn't get to sleep at all Monday night anyway...sorry.

Dear executive Committee

	With great pride I would like to nominate Jason Hudson for the
pssition of president.  I believe that Hudson more than meets the
qualifications that an APO president should have.  As an Eagle scout
Hudson has been committed to the principles of APO for a good portion of
his life.  In addition to this he has a lot of leadership experience at
WPI.  This experience comes primarlily from being an RA and also from
taking "unsung" leadership roles in APO.  From the moment Hudson started
pledging he began working as a behind the scenes leader.  .  He has really
shown that he knows not only how to get things done but how to listen and
get others involved.  I can think of countless times when Hudson has
worked to get members of the brotherhood pumped for a particular event.  

	To come into the possition of president neer the end of a term
takes a particularly strong individual.  Someone who is not going to sit
idle for even a moment.  Hudson is that type of person.  He will workright
from the moment he takes office.  

	Hudson is an inovative individual with many ideas about how to
work for the brotherhood, but more importantly he has a real heart to
serve and listen to the brotherhood.  I highly recomend Hudson for the
possition of president.

Your brother
Matthew

Hello.
	I would like to recommend Jimmy Cook for President of APO. Jimmy and I are
both brothers of Phi Sigma Kappa. At Phi Sig we have three cardinal
principles, the promotion of Brotherhood, the stimulation of Scholarship,
and the development of Character.  Jimmy is someone that exemplifies all
three of these principles.  APO has three principles as well, Leadership,
Friendship and Service.  I don't know how well I can convince you that Jimmy
exemplifies Friendship, other than that he is one of my best friends at WPI,
but I think I can convince you that he exemplifies Leadership and Service.
	Jimmy is an Eagle Scout and he was President of his National Honor Society
in high school.  At Phi Sig he was Philanthropy Chairman last spring and is
currently our House Manager.  In the two positions that I have seen Jimmy
hold he has taken a position and done his best to make it more than what it
was.  Service has become a more important part of Phi Sig because of what
Jimmy did.  I know Jimmy as someone who loves to be of service.  In the
leadership positions that I have seen him in he has done an excellent job.
Jimmy is, in my opinion, the best person to have as president of this
chapter.

Thank you.

YiLFS,
	Steve Millet

	I would like to nominate myself for the posistion of President.
This nomination does not mean that no one else could do the job.  It just
means that I would like the opportunity to lead our chapter of APO.  I am
an Eagle Scout and was Senior Patrol Leader of my Boy Scout Troop, so I
know what it takes to lead a group in service and fellowship.  I feel as
if I have a good relationship with most of the brothers, and that I am
easy going and easy to talk to.  I am enthuisastic and committed to the
ideals of Alpha Phi Omega and hope that you consider me for your
president.

Hi,

	I was thinking about it for a while and finally decided that I
want to run for president of APO. I've been in APO for about a year now
and served as Corresponding Secretary for the final term of last year. I
do have a lot of different ideas for helping to get APO back on its feet
but, admittedly, they will take time. I'm not involved as an officer of
any other organization so APO would have my full attention. I don't think
badly of any brothers so there would be no "prejudice" and I obviously
would not take sides in a disagreement. I have served on Exec Comm so I
know how the process works. Please consider me as a candidate in the
deciding process. Thank You.

Sincerely,

Vishnu Pandey

life, a passion for his work, and an enduring friendship with all those

of all that gives me the chills."

Hi,
	I'm writing to nominate Jason Hudson for President. although,
hudson is young, I am confident in his ability to learn the role of the
president quickly. He is fully of energy and very vocal; two things that
are very important for a leadership position such as this.  In my opinion,
Hudson embodies the unselfish spirit of apo. His willingness to take on
tasks, and step up and take charge will make him an excellent choice. I
urge you vote for hudson. I know that if I were given the chance I would.
thank you for your time. - Michael

If it's not to late (this is the first chance I've had to write this), I'd
like to show my supposrt for Jason Hudson as APO OI president.  Over the
past year (since he pledged), Jason has been actively involved in many of
the projects that we do.  He is willing to listen to others, but I feel
that he would be able to step in and resolve a dispute and keep brother
meetings moving without a lot of side conversation.  I hope you consider
this in your discussion.

I was just about to nominated Vishnu....he's beena  brother for at least a
semester, he was on execom for one term already and he has proven to be
very neutral.  Also, having been a brother of APO for a semester has given
him a chance to see how this brotherhood is.  I am aware that the past
spring class brings with them a lot of leadership experience from other
organizations, but as we all know, that even our first semester as
brothers, we are still lerning about APO and what it is.  And even though
taking over for a term as a new brother for an officer has been down, it
is different than taking over for the president.  Also, yes, Matthew
Erickson became SVP his first semester as a brother, but he is very
admitly against it because he would never want anyone else to be put in
that same position again; that's just too much to handle.  So, out of the
current brothers, Vishnu is probably the best choice we have.

Hello - I would like to nominate vishnu pande for the off ice of
president.  I feel he would be a good person for the job becuase of many
reasons.

My first reason is that I nknow that prior to this event, (during this
summer) he had discussed running for president in b-term and had done
research into the office.  This shows not only interst, but initiative,
which I believe is an important quatlity.  

Second, Vishnu sat on execcomm during the D99 term as a pre-tem officer.
This experience gave him a chance to see not only how an exxecomm
functions but how THIS exxecomm functions as a group and the dynamics
therin.  

Thirdly, Vishnu has shown leadership experience in the pas by being SVP
(check on that?) of his pledge class, and worked on several committees for
SEVERAL projects since he has become a brother.  

Fourth - as a brother who pledged over a year ago, he knows what goes on
during the fall (bylay review, voting, service auction) and with this
familiarity he will need less assistance from the other officers to help
oversee these projects, which in turns let's the officers have more time
with their own projects/events.  

Fifth, He is a brother who attended exxeccom not only before he was a
protem officer, but also after.  THis shows that he, as a brother, is
concerned with apo, this brotherhood, and knows that he can make a
differnece by being active.  In addition to regularly attending exxeccom,
I also see him at sercommand other commitee meetings, offereing help
wherever he can, never taking on too much that he can't handle but always
coming through when promises are made, which most of the time is more
important than taking on 50 things.  

I feel Vishu Pandey would make a wonderful pre-tem president due to his
past xperiences and with his interest expresed both before and after this
event.  

Thank you.

==============================
People will always do things 
you don't like.  Don't be the 
weaker one and give in.  Be the 
stronger one and take the high 
road.  Then point and laugh as
the other one looks like an
immature moron.

This may sound selfish, but do I need to be there the whole time?  I got
talked into helping with the A term show at the last minute, and we have
rehearsal at 7 tonight until I don't know when.  If I do need to be there
the whole time, that's fine, I'll do it. I just need to know.  Thanks.

Jimmy

I meant to write my recommendation a long time ago, sorry I didn't. 
I talked to Mike Bruno about the position.  I think he would be an IDEAL
person for the temporary president.  He has been the president before and
he knows what needs to be done.  He could step in seamlessly and carry the
chapter through the term.
He thought it would be better to allow one of the other Brothers take the
responsibility.  I don't think he would be opposed to the position though.
>From my experience with Jimmy, he is an excellent person, but can be a bit
grating at times.  He leads well when he wants to/needs to.
Vishnu is also a great person, but he can let people walk over him.  He
also doesn't speak very louldly, and a stronger person would be a better
choice.
Hudson is also a wonderful guy, with a strong, commanding charisma about
him.  He is down to earth, yet has good vision.  However he does have the
comical and carefree aire about him. 
I would love to take the position, but I cannot because of time and other
things. 
Best of luck in your decision.   Each of the candidates has strengths and
weaknesses.  Choose well!
Thank you for your time.
-Brian
ps. I assume this as given, but I would like confidentiality in my
statements above!  Thanks :)

My reccommendation, since everyone nominated would not have the
experience necessary to do the job to the standards I think it needs to be
heald I would put my money on Jimmy as he needs the experience. I have a
feeling we will be electing him to the rank of President later this year.
It would be nice to give him a quick heads up into the world of APO
politics now. not the best reccommendation ever written, but since I
just found out the nominees by email today and since I have had no chance
to talk with the people, and this is the best I could do.

I know it is late to be making recommendations, but I felt like writing this
anyways...

Although I think all 3 candidates would make excellent presidents, I have
the most faith in Hudson.

He is always upbeat and after talking to him, I sincerely feel that he
really would like to be president and is willing to put in everything it
takes to do a good job.  Hudson is at all the brother meetings, and shows up
to things most people don't (like the Rush fellowship event yesterday!!!)
Vishnu did show up for that as well, by the way...

Hudson is very enthusiastic about APO, and I believe he would be a good
moderator for meetings.  For these reasons, I would like Hudson to be our
next president.

Hey, 

. Bring the composite photos.

. Remember, they're only for people that showed up for the photo (are
pictured.)  They're the ones that paid for it.

. But whoever gets to the office, grab them out.

Hello, hello :)  Just your friendly weekly reminder that if you are for
some reason unable to go to tomorrow's meeting that is new to us, please
let Jon and myself know by 4pm tomorrow.  Also, if you have to miss (even
if we already know the reason *i.e. class*), if you have any service hours
to log, please let us know if you have them, otherwise you will be logged
as none, and we don't want that :)  Also, don't forget about the
slideshow, and I know you were all looking forward to the retention
meeting in Gompei's, but it's not happening so that you can ALL go to the
WONDERFUL slideshow!  See you all tomorrow at 6:30pm in AK116 (unless
Missy says otherwise) unless I hear from you!

BRothers

Thank you for supporting the actions of the executive committee over the
past two weeks. I would like to take a moment and explain to you the
process that was used last night in determining the new president. Then, I
will tell you who that is. I am going to ask of you the same thing I asked
of the execcom at the meeting. Please understand that the decision made is
what the group (individually) thought would be best for the CHAPTER
My role was simply to moderate discussion and tabulate votes. I did not
have a vote. I had voice only to clarify policy and questions

According to OI By-laws under the article entitled Executive committee
states that in periods of admistrative difficulty, the com has the
responsibilty of determining a plan of action. The com determined this
plan and made the brotherhood aware of this planned course of action. 

Each candiate was given 3 minutes to speak, 5 to answer questions, and
then the exec com had 10 minutes of discussion on each candidate. At the
beginning of this meeting before the speeches began, all of the
nominations that had been submitted to the chapter were read to the group,
so I want to be clear that those nominations were taken into
consideration as opinions of the chapter. Once the candidates were
finished, the group had a short general discussion on all three
candidates.

At this time, the group agreed to a few things:
to support whomever was elected
that no one, other than myself, know the actual vote count to so that no
one could declare it was fixed or set up
and after the election, they agreed not to discuss their personal votes.

All that being said, Please support and congratulate the new president
















Jason Hudson

All the candidates were qualified. A new set of elections will be held for
the upcoming year in Bterm. please support your chapter and your
president.


If you have an questions or concerns please contact me to discuss them. I
am usually home after 4pm. my number is 978 573 0920. I do read my email
daily, however, it is NOT the most effective way to reach me.

Thank you for your support in this matter

In LFS

Speaking of pledges--how would a small chapter of 5 actives get people
to join.  We had an info meeting last week in where we invited the
sectional chair and a couple of alumni to attend.  We had about 8 people
show up, and their question was--"If Alpha Phi Omega's so great, why do
you have only five actives?"  How would you answer that question without
sounding like you're making excuses.  We only had two that signed up
(but later pulled out because their parents didn't approve of
"fraternities").  I'd love to hear from chapters that went through this
and is now a thriving chapter...

Hey folkes!  Just a reminder to bring your wallets or checkbooks to the
brother meeting tonight to sign up for Conclave at UNH Nov 5-7.  This
would be an awesome opportunity for anyone who hasn't gone yet to get a
good idea of what is going to be going on here in the spring and what
types of things everyone in the brotherhood will be doing to help run it!

So mark your calendars - sign up and get ready for the weekend of your
life!  (until March 31-April 2 that is!!)

YiLFS,
jen:)

If you were at the brother meeting tonight, you now have a hard copy of the 
brother list.  And if you are on campus and were not at the meeting, you will 
be receiving one in campus mail (or in person for advisors) by the end of the 
week.  But I decided that if you want a "soft" copy for whatever reason (i.e. 
on project and just can't wait till you get back for one) you have one now 
too.  If you have any questions concerning this list, please write me at 
katiet@wpi.  Thanks :)
YiLFS,
Katie

Hello all,

As part of the Raytheon recruiting team, I was informed that the company is
putting together a "Campus Plan" that may involve funds for different
events on campus.  If your group is interested and has any events that
might benefit from corporate sponsorship, let me know and I will see if I
can get you included in the plan.

To all organizations,
    This is an e-mail to remind you that your organization must have three
forms passed into the Student Activities Office by September 30th.  They
are a revised constitution, new officers form, and the anti-hazing forms.
All of the forms are available in the SAO.  This is important because your
club/organization will not be recognized by the school if they are not
passed in by the 30th.
Thank you
Student Activities Office
