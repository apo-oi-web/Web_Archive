It is with great sadness that I write this.  Adam El-Khishin, class of
1999 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, was one of three that passed away
on the 17th in a one car accident on his way back to Washington University
Medical School from Chicago two days after his 21st birthday.  He was an
honor student in biotechnology here and was a beloved brother of Omicron
Iota.  

Adam's family has been notified and his body is being sent to Australia to
be buried in a cemetary next to the farm where he grew up.  After the
afternoon Islamic prayers, there shall be a congregation to collectively
remember him at the International House at WPI on Trowbridge St. tomorrow
at 3pm, then to be followed with a candle light ceremony on the quad at
5pm.  All are invited to attend both.

He will be greatly missed.  May he rest in eternal peace.
