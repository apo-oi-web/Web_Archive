for the benefit of brothers off campus...

actually, we do allow for absentee ballots.  you just need to send the
names of who you're voting for to the president <mbruno> anytime prior to
the election (time for him to check his email would be good).  the one
catch is that nominations are still open during elections, so you would
not know if someone was nominated that night.  but the nominations as of
the brother meeting before elections will be emailed out in the meeting
minutes.  you can always write somebody in too.

just because you're off campus doesn't mean we don't love you and cherish
your input {insert sappy sigh here}

	your servant and His,

		jon "the once and future" barlow

In response to the Question of "Can brothers who aren't at the meeting
vote for officers?"-

Yep, all any "active" brother (who is unable to attend voting due to Coop,
Projects, or an evening class (such as i.d. 2050)) has to do is email
their vote by No Later than 12 noon on Monday the 30th.
	Nominee's will appear in the apo email news letter a week before
voting [at least].
	If you have any further questions, please send them to me. thanks-

ok, since we are now recognised as an active chapter by nationals, it
would be good if we were recognised by the school.  to that end, i have an
amendment that needs to be made and voted on by the 11th of december so
that we will still be able to reserve rooms, sponsor events, etc.

the amendment will have to do with ariticle XI and i will have wording for
it at the next byrevcomm meeting.  if i forget for some reason to mention
it, stick it on the agenda so it won't get forgotten.

also, while i'm at it, do we still want to leave in the part about sending
changes through nationals before they are effective?  it would allow us to
put changes in effect a lot quicker.  i'll leave it in for now... just
wondering.  it _is_ a good check on our decisions.

happy happy turkey turkey day!

this must be done before the meeting tonight - with time for mike to check
his mail - i'd say by 1/4 of 6 the latest...

     I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the newly

Greetings,

. First of all, I hope all of you are enjoying your winter break.  I know
I'm having some peace and quiet finally (thought not as often as I'd like,
but surely more than I had at school.)  

. Either way, on to the good stuff :-)

<treasurer hat on>

. I'd like for all of the officers to think about what they plan on doing
this year.  Think of all the activities that you would like to do, and then
figure out how much you think everything is going to cost.  

. Remember, don't go wild.  We're not rich.  Just remember to count though
the little things like postage and photocopies and all that fun stuff.  Try
and itemize all of your expenses, and give me a preliminary report over
e-mail.

. Once we get to the first Exec.Com (which I believe is still set for
Friday) we'll discuss our operating budget.  

. I know some of you don't have access to e-mail, so don't worry.  Just get
it to me as soon as possible (hopefully before Exec.Com, but even if it has
to be at it, all the better.)

<treasurer hat off>

. Hehe ... and hey, why not one more hat?

<pseudo-APO Elf hat on>

. Umm ... happiness ... merriness ... joyfulness ... all that funky jazz to
you guys!

. Happy New Year! :-)

<pseudo-APO Elf hat off>

YiLFS,
Frederick Tan

You have  been added to the  APO94 mailing list (Alpha  Phi Omega Section
94) by Tom Salter <tsalter@ZOO.UVM.EDU>.

Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the
first time you subscribe to an  electronic mailing list. If you ever need
to  leave the  list,  you  will find  the  necessary instructions  below.
Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all
future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on
vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up
your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcome
messages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list.

To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,
just send mail to APO94@LIST.UVM.EDU. This is called "sending mail to the
list",  because you  send mail  to a  single address  and LISTSERV  makes
copies   for  all   the  people   who  have   subscribed.  This   address
(APO94@LIST.UVM.EDU) is  also called the  "list address". You  must never
try to send  any command to that  address, as it would  be distributed to
all the  people who  have subscribed.  All commands must  be sent  to the
"LISTSERV  address",  LISTSERV@LIST.UVM.EDU.  It  is  very  important  to
understand  the difference  between the  two, but  fortunately it  is not
complicated. The LISTSERV address is like  a FAX number that connects you
to  a machine,  whereas the  list  address is  like a  normal voice  line
connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number
when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly realize
that you  used the wrong  number and call again.  No harm will  have been
done. If on the other hand  you accidentally make your FAX call someone's
voice  line,  the  person  receiving the  call  will  be  inconvenienced,
especially if your FAX then re-dials  every 5 minutes. The fact that most
people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow
the FAX  to go through  and make  the calls stop  does not mean  that you
should continue to send FAXes to  the voice number. People would just get
mad at you.  It works pretty much  the same way with  mailing lists, with
the difference  that you are calling  hundreds or thousands of  people at
the same  time, and consequently  you can expect a  lot of people  to get
upset if you consistently send commands to the list address.

You may leave the  list at any time by sending  a "SIGNOFF APO94" command
to LISTSERV@LIST.UVM.EDU. You  can also tell LISTSERV how you  want it to
confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list. If you do not trust
the system, send a "SET APO94 REPRO" command and LISTSERV will send you a
copy of  your own  messages, so  that you  can see  that the  message was
distributed and  did not get  damaged on the way.  After a while  you may
find that this is getting annoying,  especially if your mail program does
not tell you  that the message is  from you when it informs  you that new
mail  has arrived  from APO94.  If  you send  a "SET  APO94 ACK  NOREPRO"
command, LISTSERV  will mail you  a short acknowledgement  instead, which
will look  different in your  mailbox directory. With most  mail programs
you will  know immediately that this  is an acknowledgement you  can read
later. Finally,  you can turn  off acknowledgements completely  with "SET
APO94 NOACK NOREPRO".

Following  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options
have been  set to "REPRO"  rather than  the usual LISTSERV  defaults. For
more information about subscription options, send a "QUERY APO94" command
to LISTSERV@LIST.UVM.EDU.

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a
list of the  available archive files by sending an  "INDEX APO94" command
to  LISTSERV@LIST.UVM.EDU. You  can then  order these  files with  a "GET
APO94 LOGxxxx"  command, or using LISTSERV's  database search facilities.
Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.

This  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the
digested version of the postings, just issue a SET APO94 DIGEST command.

Please note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine
that  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  "REVIEW"
command,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the
subscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a
"SET APO94 CONCEAL" command.

More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV
reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  REFCARD"
command to LISTSERV@LIST.UVM.EDU.

Greetings,

. This is going out to all officers new and from the previous term, so feel
free to comment at anytime as this is something that affects us all.

. I'm still tossing numbers around with the help of MattyG.  Here's
something to chew on before you make a decision.

. First ... forget about any kind of surplus.  Remove that from your head
and think about this situation:

		Active Brother Dues:		40/year		-> 12 to National
		Pledge Fee					10/year		-> 10 to National
		Initiation Fee				25/year		-> 25 to National

. That essentially leaves us with $28 per brother.  To further deduct from
that, there is the composite which averages to about $10 per brother
pictured.  I will guess at 80 brothers in the upcoming composite (which
maybe more than we expect, but it's an easy figure to think about).  Since
right now we have about 50 active brothers, they foot the bill at  are
paying, it's rougly $16 leaving us $12.  Then there is the pledge program
with $6 (x 45) for shirts and $6 (x 20) for senior gifts, that takes out
around $8.  This leaves us about $4 (x 50) = $200 to work with every year
on expenses.

. Expenses range from charity events we do in which we don't raise money
and therefore can't reclaim expenses, for publicity during rush, for
mailings, for the scrapbook, for more of the pledge program, for phone
bills, etc. etc. etc.

. Clearly you can see that this doesn't quite add up even close to $0.

. So there are three possibilities: a) we raise dues b) we fundraise or c)
we have major changes in our program.

. c) alone would stir major trouble.  Such decisions as limiting who can
appear in the composite, having bigs pay for little's shirts, no more
senior gifts, etc. will diminish a lot of what we do.

. b) fundraising takes a large effort to be worthwhile in my opinion.
also, one fundraising event wouldn't be enough, so we'd have to do it time
and time again.

. a) is the easiest and quickest way to raise the revenue.  Unfortunately,
it also might adversely affect people with financial difficulties (as well
encounter opposition in the brotherhood to pass.)

. But from what it sounds like, we have been ruminating about the idea of
raising dues and even having dues semesterly as opposed to yearly.  Here
are some choices:

		- $30/semester for active brothers
		- $25/semester for active brothers as well as $45 to pledge/init
		- $55 to pledge/init (keeing active dues the same)
		- some combination of dues increase with fundraising

. If you're still with me, here's my thoughts:

. The brotherhood right now is footing a major portion of the pledge
program.  This is due to the fact that right now all of the income from the
pledge/init dues go straight to national.  We could raise the pledge/init
and make them pay for all the expenses, but then that would result in
having a lopsided difference between pledging and remaining active ($40 vs
$55.)

. In my opinion, it seems peculiar for regular dues to cost more than
pledging dues coming from another fraternity.  But at the same time, the
circumstances are different, so I see the other argument.

. Either way, please toss back thoughts even if it's as simple as: "I'm
completely lost."  At least I'll know you read this far :-)

YiLFS,
Frederick Tan

Here's the abridged version of what I think:

If we are creative in where and how we get our supplies, we can save a lot of
money. There is no need to pay top dollar for everything we get. Bargain
hunt. 

If we have to raise the pledge/initiation and or dues slightly, may I
emphasize the SLIGHTLY part, it might not be so bad. But before we
increase dues, lets try to economize.

Just my 2 cents,

Hey, APO.  The bylaw revisions that we came up with in committee last term
are currently on the web thanks to House, Chris Yee, and Matt Dube.  Our
constition states that the revisions should be submitted two weeks before
voting, so voting will occur on February eighth.  I would encourage
everyone to take a look at them so we know what we are voting on when the
time comes.  Thanks, Everyone.  Have a good weekend.

Hey, everyone!
I just want to express some feelings I have had recently about some stuff.
I was really shocked at the reaction by many about the CPPC tomorrow at
the brother meeting.  I know that I am a new brother and there is a lot I
don't know and haven't seen.  But in my eyes tomorrow is an awesome
oppurtunity to voice our feelings thoughts and ideas about so much... what
we think about past events, what we feel we could improve, how we could
improve whatever that may be, new ideas about future service...  Basically
a brainstorm communication session dedicated to the brotherhood with these
really good resources to get feedback from there to help!!  It is such a
great oppurtunity!  This fraternity has so much to offer with so many
wonderful people as brothers! What shocked me was the general attitude at
the meeting.  Instead of what responses I would expect... like
"Wow, I have a lot of ideas for that!" or "Hey, this is a great
oppurtunity to get some good advice and brainstorm."  or "This will help
communication."  and more... I heard discussion about whether it is
"REQUIRED" to attend!  I know that everyone is really busy here at WPI.
BUT I don't think this attitude was very positive.  I would suspect people
to say- "Well maybe I can't commit 5 hours to this, but I will do what I
can." or "I'll try to do a little more work Sat and go for a while on
Sunday." I didn't understand the hang up about whether it is REQUIRED.
What about the brotherhood and our desire to serve?  This is a chance to
bring all the ideas together.  This is a chance to establish goals and
enthusiasm.  I sensed a big lack of enthusiasm and I felt pretty bad about
it leaving the meeting on Monday.  I know that it isn't everyone's cup of
tea to spend 5 hours talking about APO stuff on a Sunday afternoon.  But
if you look at the benefits it makes it worth the time you're willing to
put into it.  And if people come with the right attitudes, some ideas, and
an open mind SO MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED!! 

I have this really bad feeling sometimes about things I have seen so far.
Don't get me wrong- I have a sense of a REALLY strong brotherhood and I
had a very welcoming feeling pledging.  But I have seen things that to me
don't show the cooperation that goes with the brotherhood's values
overall.  I see this group as a lot of very caring people who want to work
together and make a difference.  We all have one very important value in
common, and this is why we have come together.  I know that I CAN'T
BELIEVE how fast I felt so strongly about being part of an organization
and how important being a part of it is to me.  I think this is because of
this value we share. When I see people that have problems with certain
people and really bad feelings about other brothers I get upset.  I know
that in life (as corny as this may be) that not everyone will get along,
not everyone will be close friends, and maybe someone who is a brother may
not even be someone you would want to associate with in your personal life
with your particular experiences or your particular opinions.  I also know
though that as a brother working with other brothers that has to be put
aside as best as possible.  Instead of arguing or giving each other a hard
time we need to cooperate and communicate effectively.  I know you all
know this, but as a new face coming in I may see things differently.  I
see someone acting some way that is totally opposite of everything we
stand for.  There is this COMPETITION sometimes.  And instead of
cooperating and working toward the same goal together this feeling gets in
the way.

I know this is a really long email.  But I have so much I want to say to
everyone reading this. I know our enthusiasm isn't lost. I hope that I
didn't offend anyone.  But if I did I want you to let me know.  I am
totally open for ANY comments at ANY time.  Really all I want is everyone
to try to get along and be able to say what you think without having to
worry about it being taken personally. THAT IS NOT THE POINT!  If you have
ideas or objections it is in your contribution to the brotherhood that you
are motivated by- not some personal dig at someone.  It is when people
take these words as personal attacks when that is as far as possible from
the real goal problems arise!!  I already care a lot about all of you I
have come to know so far.  And no matter what you say I keep in mind what
we share.

I am really excited about these projects coming up!  I hope we can all get
psyched for the Dance-a-thon.  If we get excited enough it can be
contagious and we can have so much fun. If people have ideas about
increasing attendance speak up.  One thing I know is that I think the
DAT signs aren't explicit enough.  So many people are confused and
don't even know what it stands for. Also with the sleepout. I have
500 letters that need to go out!  I want us to raise at least $5000!  I
really think we can do it.  If we all do just a little or if we can't do
something for lack of time or whatever express some EXCITEMENT about it!
Wait until the letters start coming back and we keep getting closer and
closer to our goal!!!  I really can't wait- but I need help getting these
out!  If you know anyone at all in a company you worked for or some
friends dad owns or some other connection get some letters from me!!!  

Please write back and tell me how you feel about what I have said.  Or
give me a call.  I really want to know how you all feel too!  And please
keep in mind the CPPC is tomorrow.  Who has something say?!!!  Who has
some good ideas??!!  

Jami

Hi Folks!

Just another message to try to keep in touch with our regular submission
people, or "correspondants" as we like to refer to you.  I had a couple of
things I'd like to mention:

- Again, thanks for all the work you do.  Through your help, Newspeak was
able to start the new semester off with a bang and the new editorial board
is happy that it all went so smoothly.

- A reminder that ALL ARTICLES AND ADS are due NO LATER THAN FRIDAY 5pm.
If you are submitting your article in hard copy, it's recommended that you
have it in our box in SAO much earlier than 5pm.  In the past, we've had
some articles come in a few minutes (or nearly an hour) late.  
Unfortunately, we cannot print those articles since our typist stops
checking email at 5pm and is only paid to work for a set amount of hours.  
If for some reason, you need to submit a late article because the event is
on Friday or over the weekend, please clear it with your respective edtior
prior to Friday and make arrangements for that editor to prepare your work
for publication.

- Also a reminder that electronic submissions are preferred.  You may
email your article as body text, but it is encouraged to include it as a
Microsoft Word 97 attachment.  If you have any questions about how to do
this, please contact US or the CCC Helpdesk.

- One last thing... If you would like to have your work pre-edited and
returned to you, we would be more than happy to set-up a "pre-deadline"
for you and assign you an editor.  Newspeak strives to print quality
writing each week.

Again, thanks...and we look forward to your future submissions.  Keep up
the good work!

Go do your post office distribution center ...

Generally, you pay for the license to do bulk mailing.  Bring
documentations indicating that you're a non-profit organization.
As non-profit, you get a general cheaper rate however your mailing will
got as "3rd class" mail which will generally take about 7-10 business days
for mail to arrive.

Again, you pay for the permit number and then you when you want to mail,
sort your mailing according to the rules and regulations of sorting mail
else they will charge you extra for sorting your mail or they can simply
refuse it.  After it's all done and weighed, they will give you the final
cost which you then pay either there or the front desk.  It's the initial
fees and costs that will be heavy ... after that...

Many schools Alumni offices are willing to actually pay for these mailings
for you. I suggest checking with the schools alumni office first. Let them
know that you are sending out a mailing to alumni. Other helpful things
would be to let them know its to keep alumni active in some respect with
the school. Also if you tell them you are asking for money from such they
might be more willing to help. Universities like it when alumni donate!
even if its done to a specified area.
They might require you to report such donations for their records.... Just
some things to consider.

Hello. Our chapter is trying to create an alumni association, and we
have a large list of alumnus, so our next step is bulk mailing. Does
anybody have the guidelines to do this, or how much it costs? Do
Non-profit organizations get any sort of discount price based on their
non-profit status?

Brothers--

        Here's some more information that's flowed into my electronic mail.
Hopefully it's informative to you all...

-John Grossi
Section 94 Chairman
Member International Relations Committee

According to Sis Tata Humoc, national executive secretary of Alpha Phi
Omega
International (Philippines) Service Fraternity and Sorority, following
are the
current fees assessed by the National Office:

INDIVIDUAL CREDENTIALS

New membership registration -- PhP200 (one time)
Membership renewal -- PhP150 (yearly)
ID replacement -- PhP50 (available to Life Members as well)

A new or renewed membership registration is required to attend the Alpha
Phi
Omega Davao City convention on May 7-9,1999.

LATEST MEMBERSHIP NUMBERS

Your ID number is yours forever. Please be sure to reference it when
applying
for membership renewal. The latest ID numbers are in the 27,000 series,
and
they are now assigned in consecutive order regardless of the gender of
the
applicant; that is, national numbers for brods and sis are now mixed
together.
To be Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant, the numbering system may change to:

CHAPTER-YEAR-NUMBER-RENEWAL, as in 0700-1973-04971-1999 or
0700-1973-04971-LIFE

If you can't remember your ID number, yours will be considered a new
application for membership, and you will be assigned the latest
available
national number.

CHAPTER/ASSOCIATION CREDENTIALS

Minimum number of brothers required to petition for a fraternity
chapter: 15
Minimum number of sisters required to petition for a sorority chapter:
10
Minimum number of alumni and/or alumnae required to petition for an
alumni
association: 10

New fraternity charter fee -- PhP3,000 (one time)
New sorority charter fee -- PhP3,000 (one time)
New alumni association charter fee -- PhP3,000 (one time)

Fraternity charter renewal fee -- PhP1,500 (yearly)
Sorority charter renewal fee -- PhP1,500 (yearly)
Alumni association charter renewal fee -- PhP1,500 (yearly)

A new or renewed charter is required of a chapter or alumni association
to
participate in the APO convention. Petitioning groups interested in
getting
recognized by APO-Philippines soon may submit the requirements for
consideration at either of the following events:

1. National Executive Board (NEB) meeting on Saturday, March 27, 1999,
at the
new National Office
2. National Convention on Friday-Sunday, May 7-9, 1999, in Davao City

LATEST CHAPTER/ASSOCIATION

As of today, March 8, 1999, there are 257 recognized fraternity chapters
(Kappa Pi was the latest name awarded), 104 sorority chapters, and 95
alumni
associations.

POSTAGE ALLOWANCE

All the fees above are in Philippine pesos. Please convert to your
currency
accordingly and allow a few extra dollars, yen, pounds, etc., for the
cost of
postage from the Philippines to your present country of residence or
work.

MAILING ADDRESS

Because APO-Philippines is between National Offices, Tata prefers that
correspondence be mailed to:

Sis Tata Humoc, National Executive Secretary
Office of Congressman Brod Eduardo Pilapil
House of Representatives
Quezon City, Metropolitan Manila
Philippines

Brothers,
	Our chapter is at a point in its development where growth has
become necessary for us.  We have all heard in the ceremonies that
leadership is one of the central principles of Alpha Phi Omega.  But I am
not sure that that means the same thing to everyone.
	Anybody can be a leader in APO.  Recall from the ceremony the
other night the part about "following some and leading others".
Leadership takes place in committees, by organizing service projects and
just by being a participating member of APO.
	Our chapter needs leaders, and there are a lot of ways that we can
learn to lead.  One opportunity is the Chapter Program Workshop.  I went
to one last summer.  A CPW is an opportunity to learn where we stand as a
chapter and how to develop a program and direction for us, your chapter.
Other opportunities include leadership conferences, or just plain
participation.  If you are interested in running for an office next
B-term, come see what we are doing now.  Most of the officers want to pass
on any information that you are interested in.
	Please keep this stuff in mind over the next few weeks and over
the summer.  There are still some slots for the CPW's this year.  I am
probably going to one or another of them.  The most important thing is
that we are keeping in mind what is best for the chapter.  Nothing but
good can come of it.  I am looking forward to seeing you all this summer
(I hope) and be sure to ask me if you are interested in what you can do
for the chapter.

YILFS!,
Tony

Guys, this attachment is a letter that I want to send to Vantine Studios
about their visit last Spring.  I don't know if you are all familiar with
the circumstances I am complaining about, but they are covered in the
letter.  If you have any questions about it, email me.  Just let me know
what you think of the letter and all that.

Hope you guys are having a good summer.  I hope there are some activities
coming up soon so we can see each other.  Have a good summer.

Dear APO Brother,

I would like to update the Brotherhood 
with my current contact information.

In 2 weeks I leave Worcester for St. Louis.
My mailing address in St. Louis as of 1st August:

	Olin Residence Hall
	Room 918
	4550 Scott Avenue
	St. Louis, MO 63110

I will update with my new e-mail address as soon 
as it becomes available.

Aside:  After my initiation back in 1996 I never
received a shingle.  Nila requested one last year
and should it eventually arrive could it be mailed
to the above address.  My national identification
number is 276312.

YILFS,

Beginning soon, I will no longer be able to act as the president of OI.  I
am turning over all of my duties to the executive committee of the
chapter.  Administrative authority will lie with Melissa Kachura, as
dictated by our constitution.  Barring objections, this will take place
immediately, as I am no longer able to perform in this capacity.

My reasons are of a personal nature.  I have no problems with the chapter.
If anyone has any questions they are welcome to email me or call.  I wish
you all well.

YiLFS,
Tony Z

Brothers,

	As you all know at this time, Tony can no longer serve as
president of OI.  Wednesday morning, Execomm held an emergency meeting in
order to decide on a course of action for installing a new president.
During this meeting, we discussed options and then voted on the course we
would take in the upcoming weeks.  What was decided upon was that between
today, September 9 and Saturday September 18 at noon, Execomm will be
accepting recommendations for the presidential office from the
brotherhood. These recommendations must be a substanitive and detailed
explanation as to why. Please submit these recommendations to
apo@wpi.edu.  Additionally, anyone submitting a recommendation must have
discussed it with the brother they are recommending and have recieved
approval from that brother.  A brother can recommend themselves.  On
Sunday September 19 (a regularly scheduled ExeComm), ExeComm will vote on
all the submitted candidates as to determine the next president.  This
vote will be run by our section chair, Marilyn Mims.  Thank you.

I would just like to formaly say that I believe the meathod you have
chosen for selecting the president is out of line.  

I know that with our constitution we can suspend the rules and elect a
President in a short matter of time.  As it is I believe what you are
doing would require suspending the rules for and election and that
requires a 2/3 majority vote by the entire brother hood.  The Executive
commitee can not just make up there own rules as they go along they need
to get permission from the brother hood first.

I strongly beleive that you should have informed the brothers of your
emergency meeting.

I would like to send out my apologies for not making it to execomm.  After I
got back from the retreat I just crashed to catch up on sleep... then I
didnt wake up till 3pm.  Doh!  I have to study for my exam in CS tomorrow
(mon.).  So, I went right to studying.  I havent checked my email since
friday so I was unaware of the holding of execomm tonight.  I ended up
studying right through it.

But I as far as the details of the meeting tonight.  Informing the
brotherhood of how and why we reached the decision we did and why they were
not informed of the emergency meeting sounds like a good idea.  I know some
people that had some "dislike" about being left out in the cold... if I may
say.

see ya at the brother meeting.

Sorry Again,
Colleen
