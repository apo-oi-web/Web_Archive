I'm not going to publish a full set of mionutes here, but I thought the
entire brother hood would like to know issues that were discussed, and get a
heads up on what will eventually be brought to the brotherhood for a vote..
If this doesn't intrest you, press 'D' now and move on, cause that's all
there is and there ain't no more....


Issue #1:
	A review of the procedure of counting ballots for pledge voting.  In
Essence the proposal that was voted and passed with recommendation by the
comittee revised the procedure to make it virtually identical to the way in
which ballots for officers elections are counted.  a virtul re-write of the
proposal follows...
{denotes existing text}

"..{the ballots will be counted by 2 members of} the Membership Committee as
well as one (1) graduating senior whom does not serve on either the
Membership committee or Executive Committee.

Proposed by Matt Grabowski


Issue #2
	This issue revolved around the number of service hours needed to
remain an active brother.  Due to many reasons, the comittee passed the
proposal with recomendation to the chapter, especially in light of a
possible growing number of projects and the fact that most other chapters
demand much higher amounts.

	The change simply replaces "(8) eight" with "(16) sixteen" anywhere
the number of service hours is mentioned in the bylaws.

proposed by Matt Grabowski

Issue #3
	This issue was a discussion on the addition of a third type of
status as a brother, the "associate member".  This member would not have
voting privledges, would be required to do a lower number of service hours,
and still pay dues.  This was meant as an alternative to becoming inactive
for brothers that are vastly during a certain time period (term, semester
year, college career) want to reamin active, but do not have the time to do
the projects with the chapter.
	
	The actual amendment was too long to re-type here, but you get the
jist.

this proposal was tabled in definitely.

proposed by : Kathryn Thorsen
