Hiya folks!!

There's bowling tonight and tomorrow, so go down there and have some fun!

On Feb 9th the brother meeting will be held in SL105, where we will have a
potluck dinner.  So dig out those recipes (What?!  you don't have recipes?
time to call up those parental units) and cook some food!  Don't forget to
go hungry, too, because everyone else will be doing the same thing.  Well,
all the COOL people, anyways.... :)

Starting next week APO will be staffing the free bowling on Friday and/or
Saturday nights.  While you're there, you can BOWL!!! (not for dollars,
though)  So talk to Matt Grabowski for more info.

On Feb. 11 we will be sleeping with each other   on the quad.  It's for
charity;  people will give donations for brothers to sleep on the quad.
There will be hot chocolate and coffee available in a warm room (courtesy
of DAKA).  

There's a trip to see the Harlem Globetrotters coming up soon; see Kristin
St. John for details.  

Brother meeting Monday: 6:30 in HL 2nd floor (I forgot what the room
number is).  We will be discussing Important Stuff.  For all you Bigs out
there, make sure you attend.  

Induction:  After the brother meeting!!  SH 203 7:30.

This is Chris, signing off from the APO news desk in my room.  Good day.

Hey all,
	I'm writing to remind everyone that APO has a basketball game tonight and
everyone should go.  Midterms are over so no one has an excuse why they
aren't there.  So come on down and cheer on the team as battle to increase
their winning streak.

This is just a note to remind everyone what happened at the pledge meeting
on Tuesday 2/3/98.

The following are three email addresses that you can email to:

   apo-pledges@wpi.edu		goes to all pledges, pledge trainer, and MVP
   aponews@wpi.edu		goes to all APO brothers
   apo-staff@wpi.edu		goes to all APO officers

It has been decided that pledge meetings will be held on Wednesdays from
9-10pm, but the place is still TBA.  There will be no pledge meeting held
this Wednesday.

If you ever have to miss a meeting, you need to call or write to Matthew
Erickson beforehand.  His email address is mlerick@wpi.edu and his phone
extension is 6728.

Brother meetings are held every Monday at 6:30 in HL 218.  

In the near future, we will be making nametags so we can get to know each
other and the brothers can learn our names.

Start thinking about pledge class officers.  The following list is of the
possible offices to hold:
	President
	Fellowship Vice President
	Service Vice President
	Court Jester
	Secretary

If you have any questions, please email pledge trainer, Matthew Erickson,
at mlerick@wpi.edu.

Three things people,

1. You have pleadge sheets!. Each Brother needs to get $20 in pleadges.
That is the set minimum. Do your best. Ask Professors and staff. They love
to help out and donations are the easiest way.

2. The Sleep Out starts at 4:00 to set up things on the Quad. We need to
get like 8 people there to set up. I will be in class so email me if you
can be there.

3. The plan is if you have not got a sheet and I have not taled to you
email me. Gab, Tara, Beth, Mel, MattE, and Tim they should be in your
boxes. If you have not signed up with me to Sleep Out then I need your
name emailed to me so that I know you are suppoed to be there. 

That is all,

Mattyg

I can do the bowling thing Friday night, pretty much any time I'm needed,
but I have pep band tonight at 5, so I can't work on the posters.

Hi all,
	I recieved the pins and pledge manuals in the mail today, so they
will be given out at the next brother meeting along with some other
sundrious stuff. So, It is very important that you come to the brother
meeting on Monday. Pledges, if you can't you need to clear that up with the
pledgetrainer, Matthew. 
	We have also decided that big/little assignments will be randomly
chosen with exceptions to pledges who would like us to take something 
into special consideration, such as male/female,
upperclassmen/underclassmen. So pledges should email me if they have any
concerns. Any brother who still hasn't signed up to be a big and wants to
be, this is the last call!!!

	In other news, the captain of the intramural team asked me to
relay to you that there is a basketball game on friday night at 7:00 pm in
alumni gym. Even if you have never seen a basketball before, you are
invited to play, just be a good sport and play to have fun.  
OK. that's all. have a good one.

YiLFS,
Nila

If you can help me out please do.

Hi Everybody;
	Just a quick reminder that there is a b-ball game at 7 in Alumni
this friday (tomorrow). We need as many people to come as possible. It
will be a good chance to meet and socialize. You don't have to be a good
player just a good sport. Hope to see you there. -Mike

I'm not sure if this got to the pledge list, but there is an intramural
game tomorrow night at 7 in Alumni.  This would be a good chance to meet
brothers and have fun <hint>.  

Oh yeah, if you want to play, there's plenty of room on the team.

Hi,
	As some of you already know the game for tomorrow was changed
last minute to tonight. APO was able to put together a team of four and
play CBF (last year's champions). One might think that we were doomed but
as luck  would have it, we played quite well. We went into overtime 19-19
and lost 22-24. It was a great game! Our next game is friday the 13th
against FIJI. Join us :)

Some of you pledges may not yet be aware of this but next week on
Wednesday night(the night before achademic advising day) APO will be
sleeping out on the Quad to rais money for the homeless.  You are all
encouraged to participate the onlything required is that you rais at least
twenty dollars in pledges if you plan on participating.  I realize that we
neglected to tell you this sooner and you don't have much time to find
sponsors before the big event so we will be flexible ith the amound of
money required for participation.  If you would like to participate please
let me know tonight(thursday) or early tomorrow(Friday) and I will get
pledge sheets in  your mail boxes tomorrow.  I guess that meens you should
tell me your box number since I do not yet have a roster.

anyone to beet my goal of $100 before the sleep out. Plus there is a free
large pizza from Gompies in it if you get the gee golly most pleadges.
I challenge you to get those pledges!!!

1. Thanks to all the 40 Brothers and Pledges who converged on the UMOC
table Friday at 2:30. That was amazing. I am sorry to have made you all do
that but I am overjoyed to know that you all took the time out to go sit
because I thought noone would be arround. Thanks so much. 

2. Here is the Wedge sitting list for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Need some more people to sign up for a few spots.
Especilly need openers and especially for monday cause I can't open for I
have class at Clark at 10:00. Plus the 2:30 to 3:30 is empty so since 30+
don't have class please sign up.
Thanks tons!,

	Hello my friends!

	Some of you have already have me take your picture with my camera.
Melanie has been asking to take your pics with the digital camera.

	Advantages:

	1) No scanning on our part--makes the spread thin yearbook
committee's life easier!!!!
	2) Cheaper for the fraternity--no film developing, etc.
	3) No formatting and fighting the different sizes and all this
good stuff...it's simple....

	It simply involves you standing still for 1 second,  and you're
finished and in the process you have saved everyone some time!  

	Any questions--send us email, cool?

	Keep Smiling Y'all!
	YiLFS,
	Gabe Flores :-)

	Does anyone have a bunch of plastic forks that they could bring to
the meeting tomorrow night?  If so please email me asap.  It would be a
shame if we all this food and nothing to eat it with...

for all of you in the fall 97 pledge class... this is a reminder that you
will need to dress down for the metting tonight - actually for the
post-meeting activities.  there has been some concern about people either
not being able to make it or not having clothes.  don't fret!  if you
cannot make it tonight, we can easily arrange for you to partake at a
later date.  if you have no bad clothes, wear the worst you've got.  your
clothes will stay clean if you are careful :)  

that's all.  hopefully i'll have a digicam to capture the event in
electrons.  happy monday!

	your servant and His,

		jon "close as a heartbeat" barlow

	Since no one seems to have and plastic forks, I would suggest
bringing your own fork to the meeting tonight.  I just don't like the idea
of eating lasagne with my hands!

This week!  UMOC is ending this week, so make sure you vote for the
ugliiiiest of the uuuuugly.  including FROOT!! Who happens to be winning
right now.
Ugly Man on Campus (UMOC) continues this week until 3:30 Wednesday.

Speaking of Wednesday, here comes the sleepout on the QUAD!  Starting at
4PM Wednesday and ending 8AM Thursday is our first annual sleepout on the
Quad for charity.  We will be sleeping out there and raising awareness
about homeless peoples' issues.  Make sure you get your $20 donation!
If you can beat Matt Grabowski's pledge total (he's aiming for $100), you
get a free large pizza, so keep asking everyone you know.

Bowling will not be staffed this weekend by APO, but we will be doing
something "big with SGA" according to Mr. Grabowski.

The Worcester City Cleanup has been moved to April 4, so mark your
calendars.  Because WPI is hosting this city wide service event, APO will
be sponsoring (tentatively) a dance-a-thon!  That way, people will
participate in the cleanup, and then go dance.

Conclave is coming up March 20-22.  It's at Maine Maritime Academy.
Conclave is the special name given to our sectional conference.  Actually,
Conclave is run by 2 sections, 94 and 96.  Sections 94/96 used to be one
section, 95.  Anyways, in other sections in the country, you will hear the
term "sectionals" or "sectional conference."  At Conclave there are
service projects that are scheduled for Saturday afternoon, and during
the morning there are workshops (massage, leadership, egg cooking, gyro
balancing, etc).  Friday night is a social night, as is Saturday night
because of a banquet and dance.  It costs $28.  If you are interested in
more info, contact Matt Grabowski (mattg).

Next February some people will be going to see the Harlem Globetrotters at
the Centrum.  Tickets are $7.50 and can be negotiated through Kristin St.
John.

SKIING!! At the end of the term, Nila's parents have graciously allowed to
house and partially feed us so we can go on a ski trip.  Apparently the
ski lift tickets ard rentals are cheap.

No movie night tomorrow, but the next week will see the return of movie
night wil "The 5th element);

Hi Everyone!
	I just wanted to let you all know what I will be doing regarding
my sig.  I would like it if we could get together in small groups or on an
individual basis so that we can get to know each other better. I usually
go to dinner around 5:30 in Morgan, anyone is invited to join me.
Otherwise, we can make time on the weekend ( my # is x6223). I look
forward to see you all.

Hi,

Just to let you know that this will be the last week of Intramural Basketball
games.  We will schedule playoffs next week so that they can be completed
before finals week.  Schedules will be posted on the bulletin boards in Alumni
Gym and here at the Healthy Alternatives Office by Monday.  Your scores for
this week absolutely have to be in our office by 8:00am Monday morning so we
can complete the playoff schedule.  Also a reminder that if you had 3 forfeits
you are not eligible to be in the playoffs as you were told in the beginning
of the intramural season.  Please let all the team members know of this change
in the games for next week.  Friday will be the last game to count towards
your playoff points.

Thanks, 
Dianna

Hy gang, 

	Well I hope you all had a swell time at the meeting yesterday.  I
have heard quite a bit of postive feed back especialy from brothers that
are pumped about getting to know you all.  Three signatures will not be
required at tomorows meeting but everyone should be able to get at least
one signature for tomorrow.  If you see someone that you recognize from
the meetng last night please feel free to introduce yourself and don't be
afraid to ask their name. The brothers realize that you have a lot of new
names to learn and will not be offended.  On the same tolken the brothers
have a lot of new names to lear as well so don't be offended if they do
not remember your name.  

Don't forget to be thinking about offices.  We will be nominating people
for offices tommorrow.  The offics that needto be filled are:
	President
	Service Vice President
	Fellowship Vice President
	Secretary 
	Court Jester
I highly recomend taking a leadership position in the pledge class it is
very fun and very rewarding.

The meetings on Wednesdays will be in Higgin's Labs 116 directly below the
discovery classroom.

See you tommorow,
Matthew

P.S. If you havn't figured it out yet I use my own special way of speling
many words.

HI 
	A few friendly reminders....  :)
	Just so you all know, when you come to a brother meeting, don't
forget to sign the list for attendance and write down the number of
service hours you did for that week. That is the way I keep track of
attendance. If you did happen to missthe sign in list this week, it's ok,
just remember from now on. 
	You should all wear your pledge pins on campus at all times.
(except in the shower and when you are sleeping, etc.) This is to identify
you as an APO pledge and show your pride in the fraternity. If something
happens to your pledge pin, let me know asap.
	Work on getting to know people and have brothers sign your book
after you get to know them. 
	I hope you all had a good time at the meeting last night. 
YiLFS,
Nila

Ok here is the long deal

1. Sleep out Tomorrow. We have to do some stuff like Chill out and rake in
the dow. We will be setting up at 4:00PM. Quad near Harrington. 
Rules:
1. If you come and leave early you have to tell me.
2. After dark everyone is getting checked on regularly.
3. Weare layers of cloaths that you can juggle so that if you are hot for
a while you can put back on when you get cold.
4. There is absolutely no sleeping on the Quad. (A little in Morgan A)
5. If anyone wants to cook some Brownies or cookies and bring them by that
would be great. If you want to do that and not go too far away you can use
my appartment.
 I got the cardboard and T&G is running us in the Paper either Wed. or
Thurs. Be there and be cold if you signed up.

2. UMOC ends Wed. at 3:30. If you are in ATO, SAE, AGD, APO, SGA, or any
of the other organizations represented make sure to bug them cause it's
all over at 3:30.

3. There will be a SerComm Meeting and I have alot of work to give out.

Dear APOers,

	As some of you have heard by now, my mother passed away last week.
As a result of this tragedy, my life has had to take a serious shift. I
will be commuting the rest of the year to be with my father as we need
each other for support.
	Why this email, then? As impersonal as it may be (which may come
as no surprise to those of you who know me for writing emails), I would
much rather say my goodbye to everyone at a meeting, but due to the
circumstances, email is my only option.
	I thank all of you that I befriended and everyone for all the
great times I've had in my membership to this organization since my
freshman year (amazing how time flies...). APO has always been a side
"hobby" for me, if you will. I tried as hard as I could to attend events,
but something always seemed to get in the way. And now that I look back on
my time here, I wish I had spent alot more time as a part of the
organization, especially as a Big Brother. But alas, that time for me has
long passed, and I just want to express this concern so that others may
reflect on it (I'm still scatterbrained - excuse my existentialisms :).

	So although I wished I could have said this at a meeting or some
event, I am unable due to this tragedy. Thank you all kindly, and good
tidings. (Say hi to me if you see me. ;)

Yours in Leadership, Friendship and Service,
Brian

Hi everybody,
	I got this email and wanted to pass it along to the brotherhood
and get a general concensus on it. Should we do something and if so than
what? I know that we've got lots of "creative"  thinkers in APO, so if you
have a feasible idea than send it to me. Thanks

						-Mike
 Hi Mike,

I understand that you are the contact person for APO, and that you are
interested in doing something for Quadfest this year.  If you have any
ideas or suggestions, feel free to email them to
quadfest@duckie.kluge.net  or drop in on one of our meetings (Mondays at
6pm in the Goat's Head Conf. Room).

Thanks!
 - Craig and Aimee

Hey you know you wouldn't get away for the weekend without me sending you
lots of mail did you? Ofcourse not silly.

Anyway I am going to Conclave on March 20 - 22 up in Maine at Maine
Maratime Academy, Phi Epsilon Chapter. For anyone who still is unclear, it
is a little conference for all the chapters in New England to get together
and have some fun and get to know eachother. (Oh ya and we do some service
too.) 

So here's the deal. Those exec people were cleaning the office out
instead of having a meeting, and we seem to have stumbled across a little
plaque that says WPI brought the most pledges the farthest to the Conclave
at MMA in 1992. That was a long time back and OH how many pledges and
brothers we have now.

 So here is the challenge. We want to win this years Man Mile Award, which
is given to the chapter that travels the most miles. In math terms you sum
over all the brothers from a chapter times the number of miles.

So if you think that you want to go get in touch with me. via email or
call 799-5061, or just put a check in my box 438. I will sign people up
again this week. if I can get a bunch of checks here. Make them payable to
APO-Phi Epsilon Chapter. That way I can just send them out without
thinking about it.

List of people that have expressed interest but have not paid me is this.

Jeff J.		 My little #1

Mike Burzycki

one day of skiing. 
learn to ski package, includes lift ticket, lesson(s), and rental $35

groups of ten or more

hours midweek 9-4/ weekend 8:30-4

For more info check out ragged-mt.com. It's a cool little mtn, short lift
lines and great prices. plenty of beginner, intermediate and expert stuff.

non skiing stuff:
I need definite numbers of people by this friday. My mom needs to know how
much to cook. If you are vegetarian, diabetic, etc let me know and we'll
do something for ya in the way of food. You need to plan on buying you own
lunch, or bring it. (may I recommend tuna and crackers, because the
cafeteria at the ski place is pricey!)  mom will do breakfast and supper. 
You'll need your own blankets or sleeping bag. You'll be sleeping on the
floor in the basement, or if you want a bed there's the log cabin, which
has no electricity or bathrooms, but a woodstove. And mom said you have
to like dogs. You are responsible for finding your own ride, but there are
plenty of people who can take you if you don't have a car. Kevin King has
a pickup so he can probably take your skiis. Contact him bout that.
You should plan on getting to my house as soon as you can after classes
are done, and leave sunday morning. you can leave earlier or come later,
just need to know in advance.
So decide on whether or not you are going and let me or kristin the FVP
know by friday.  thanks. -Nila



How to get to Nila's house.
Take 290 east, then 495 north.
Take I-93 north. Get off at exit 23. Take a right at the end of the exit
ramp. Go east on rte 104 through the town of New Hampton, past the
Meredith Tradfing Post, Meredith Animal Hospital and two hayfields. There
wil be an American legion sign and flag pole on the right side of Rt 104.
Turn right onto Hatch Corner Rd at the flag pole, about 8 miles from
exit 23.  Proceed down hatch corner road a short distance past a yellow
and a brown house. At the bottom of a
little hill, take a left onto a long gravel driveway, just before the
white house. the driveway is unmarked. I live in a house that is natural
wood color, partially underground and you will approach from the back near
the garage. Park near the garage!!! do not drive down the hill past the
garage!

Heh, oh yeah, Conclave. Forgot I paid for that. :) I still want to go,

since I won't be at meetings?  Thanks a bunch.

Hi--
	I have been trying to use the public alias for a minimum of
yearbook stuff, but i talked to a couple people about helping out and i
don't know their emails.  Soooo....if you would like to help setup the
yearbook brother pictures or candids and you have a knack with PowerPoint
and image cropping (or even if you don't), please mail me and tell me when
you think you will have free.  Pledges won't be in the book (besides
candids), but it's a good chance to start recognizing brothers and get
clues for your scavanger hunt.  I'm not promising organized info, but if
you're willing to help i could sure use a pair of hands!  Mail me or stop
by the meeting 4:30 today in the Wedge...Thanx--

Hi all- I know that we have been bugging you all for pictures and bios and

want to get now is a list of EVERYONES' birthdays.  So if you could please
send me a quick email with it.  It won't take you long.  Do it right now.
Hit "R", "N" ( cuz everyone doesn't need their boxes flooded) and then hit
8/4/78( or whatever your birthday is ), and Ctrl X.

See that wasn't so bad!  Thank you for your 28 seconds!

Hi everyone,
	A poll of the pledges last night showed that there hasn't been
very much big/liitle interaction. It was kind of sad really. Pledges are
in kind of a scarry situation where they are expected to get to know the
brotherhood, and the big brother program is supposed to help them out in
this respect. At least that's how I felt when I pledged. Please make an
effort to do something with your little very soon. It can be wwhatever you
think is fun. Be imaginitive. If you are having trouble, let me know, I'll
do wahtever I can to help.

Nila

I just got ICQ to work on UNIX, and my # is 8489684, but I think that you
have to actually install it on your account if you want to use it on UNIX.
P.S.: My IM alias is still joexner56

Hi everyone,
	I have a few concerns about the signing of pledge manuals. First,
keep in mind that the point of getting brother's signatures is to get to
know brothers and for brothers to meet pledges. Please keep this in
mind before you ask the pledges to go looking for random bit of info that 
might be hard to find.  In my opinion it is more important that you talk
to the pledge than them knowing random info such as how to spell the name
of your hometown. Communicate to then through your attitude that they as a
person are important to APO.
	I know some of you are going to say it's tradition, but
I feel that this really is not a good thing. It will only make the
pledges who are treated this way do the same thing to future pledges when
they become brothers. Also, the pledges have a way cool scavenger hunt of
some interesting stuff. It's meant to be a conversation started if needed. 
	So, have fun with getting to know everyone and try to make the
signature part of pledging a positive experience. If anyone else has
questions/comments/words of wisdom feel free to talk to me.

Nila

Well in an amazing turn of events, apo b-ball team is in the play-offs
(don't ask me how). Anyway, the play-offs start soon. As soon as Sat. I'll
send out exact times and places when I get back to my room and can look it
all up. 
	More importantly though, WE NEED PEOPLE TO COME PLAY! Please, if
you have even the smallest interest in playing show up. We could really
use the numbers (5 or more is good). Well I get the rest of the info to
you asap. Thanks -MIke

Hosted by Matt Dowling, this Family Feud styled game will make you laugh
and learn about those nasty little habits like:

	Why do men always leave the toilet seat up?

Just a reminder to all, APO will be meeting in the WEDGE @ 7:30 ON FRIDAY
to go see the Orange Crush concert together in Riley Commons.   What is
Orange Crush? It's a fizzy, orange drink from the eighties, and it's also a
really rad band that plays tons of songs from the 80's!  So join in the fun,
and get to know the new pledge class! (Pledges- this is a great opportunity
to get sigs!)  Also, there will be a hot tub on the quad from 3:00 to
Midnight if you want to take a dip.  Have fun!

Hi guys!
    I just wanted to remind all of you that we are having a meeting on
Saturday at 2:00pm in the Lower Wedge to talk about our service project.
As you all know, we have to complete this project as part of our
requirement.  We are on a somewhat tight time schedual for planning.  We
have to come up with three good ideas for projects and present them to the
brothers at the March 16th meeting (which is the first Monday after
break). They will vote on the one they like best that night.  After that
meeting, we only have three weekends before our induction, and one of them
is going to be the lock-in.
    I know that we don't want the meeting to be long and boring! If we
can all come with a least one idea for a project, we can hopefully have
three great ideas.

Hope to see lots of you on Saturday at 2:00pm in the wedge.....

Jen Hardy

Hi everyone, 
I hope you all are planning something fun to do with your big/little
pairs. Yusef suggested that we take advantage of the bowling lanes for an
icebreaker. There are a bunch of activities tonight including the chili 
cooking and other winter carnival
stuff too. SO, don't be shy, get in touch and have fun. Bring your pledge
manuals if you are a pledge, it will probably be a good time to get sigs
and meet brothers. 
Yilfs,
Nila
Ps.  DOn't forget that today is the *LAST* day to confirm if you want to
go skiing. You can email me, stjohn@wpi, voicemail me X6232, whatever.

	Hello to all!

	We need some *serious* help!

	We need a committee of at least ten or fifteen people to help with
the Yearbook. Melanie has been working relentlessly at putting together a
format and a layout design on the computer for the yearbook.  She has
spent countless hours scanning, transcribing bios, and so forth.  The
present committee of four people are all active and busy--Including
Melanie Heck who has spent innumerous amounts of time on this!!

	Finals are approaching and so is the end of the term--

	Here is what we need--
	People to volunteer on helping to finish layout and design...
	People to help refine and spice up the bios...
	People to help with fromatting and form ideas...
	People to help with printing efforts, etc...
	People to help with anything else I'm not thinking of!
	
	Everybody needs Hours--these count!  Every Pledge needs a
committee or MORE--this counts!

	Melanie will be going on an IQP to Puerto Rico next term, so lets
pull together a strong group of people so that there is confidence that
this yearbook will be successfully published when she returns!!!

	Jen Stauff is running the committee-- jls@wpi.edu,  and I'm
willing to offer suggestions and help when I can.  Please contact any of
us (Melanie is blackft@wpi) about this--SOON!

	This is a time when the Brotherhood pulls together to accomplish
great things!!!!

	Thanks!!
	YiLFS,
	Gabe Flores

Hey :o).

How's everyone doin?  Well, I noticed that some of you were not able to
attend last wednesday's pledge meeting... and missed out on a couple of
stuff.  Basically, the pledge class divided up into two commitees...
service or fellowship... it is your choice.  As FVP, I am with fellowship
and Jen is SVP and she is with service.  So, if you want to be part of the
fellowship committee and was not there wed. then come to our meeting on
monday right after the brother meeting.  If you want to be part of this
committee and for some reason can't come to monday's meeting, then e-mail
me.  Then I will send you a message regarding to what happened and the
ideas we came up with and then I can get your feedback that way.  Of
course, if you are interested in service... Jen sent you all e-mail with
the time for her meeting.  So, if you have any questions or anything...
please, feel free to e-mail me :o).  Now, I must be off... have a great
weekend!

Colleen

the worst weekend of my career at WPI. Anyway, This is a reminder to get
your money collected and ready for me by Monday's meeting. This way I can
get it all to the various placces that it need s to go. Some to Castine

is really it. If you are going to Mustard Seed I will get you later
tonight and if you are going to Conclave and didn't pay me you better
Email cause it's all going out Monday Morning!

That is all,m

Hi guys!
    We just finished our first service meeting, and I want to bring you
all up to speed.  We have three ideas so far, but none have been
finalized yet.  We'll be talking more about these ideas on Wenesday, but
here is a preview:

Car Wash
   We would wash cars (as the name implies :) ) and donate the money to
a charity.  It would take place all day on a Saturday or Sunday.  We are
thinking March 28 or 29 or April 5.

Park Clean-Up
   We were thinking either Institute Park or the park near Price
Chopper.  It would bascially be picking up trash and other fun stuff.
It also would take place on a Saturday or Sunday, March 28 or March 29
or April 5.

Nursing Home Fun
     This is a little different from the other two.  We are thinking
about making a card or craft project one night here.  Then we would set
up several nights where we would go down and visit and socialize with
them or whatever they want us to do.  This way it wouldn't be an all day
commitment, rather two nights during the month of March.

None of these ideas are final or set in stone.  If anyone has any ideas,
call or email me!  This is our project, and we want as much input as we
can get!

Thanks to Brian Morgan, Tony Zamarro, Emily Reynolds, Joel Thibault,
Jenn Patoulidis, Andrea Emery, and Fred Tan for coming to the meeting
today :)

hi everyone.
	A lot of people have asked me to have some sort of big/ little
something or other so you can get together. If you have any ideas let me
know via email or in person. We have already suggested a big/little
cookoff or bowling tournament. other ideas are welcome. In light of all
the people wishing to have an event like this, maybe we will move the
big/little olympics up a little. Tell me what you think.0

Hey peoples......


I have two things that I think I should tell yall. 
1.) To get the sig of this guy who sends out all these emails you just
have to hang out and talk to me for about 20 Minutes or so. (Please don't
ask me if you don't have your pin and your book with you cause then I
really can't. 

2.) For any of you all who come to sercomm there will be no meeting this
week. But I encourage you to come and see what is up the first full week
of D-Term. I get to go over everything that we do for the year (so you get
to learn alot about what we do) and then we get to set all the dates for
stuff for the next year. All in ALL a hugely important meeting. My word!.

Anyway sorry to bug you all with this. I just have to flood the boxes as
often as I can. It is a procrastination thing!.. he he he!!

YiLFS <--have you figured this out yet? It is sometimes a pledge quiz question

Hey, people :o)

Okay, there's one thing to be prepared for... lots of LATE e-mail from
me.  I am a WPI trained night owl :o).  (*sigh*)... sleep... the
forbidden pleasure :o).   ANYWAYS...  getting down to business.  We had
our first fellowship meeting tonight (or shall i say last night... okay
less confusing... mon. night).  And we came up with some *pretty kewl*
ideas, a whole variety to choose from :o).  As a committee, we wanted to
come up with events that would allow us as a pledge class to get to know
one another and the brothers as well.  These ideas listed below are just
"skeleton" ideas... I will hopefully have more details about some of
them for wednesday's pledge meeting.  So here we go...

1)  ROLLERSKATING - A favorite activity for people of *all* ages at a
nearby rink called Skylite.  We were especially interested in playing
80's music as a theme, but, of course that is open to question.  Just
think... all those that went to Orange Crush last friday... all that
fun... except now on roller skates!  This of course will cost money...
and I am going to call Skylite and get the scoop on costs and
possibility of reservations and what days available.
THEN... after skating... if on weekend... we can possibly enjoy a
SLUMBER PARTY!  (with pasta??... ask Tanya ;-).  Of course, a place to
hold this slumber party is negotiable... but we think that Founder's
basement would be a good place to hold it considering how many people
are in the pledge class and APO.

2) DANCE PARTY - We could enjoy a night of dancing to all kinds of
music. The provider for music is still up to question but there is a
possibility of having 94.5 or 95.5 DJ for us... BUT THIS IS STILL JUST
TALK... not for certain.   THEN... the slumber party option afterwards
like #1.

3) POOL - Many of us enjoy shooting pool.  We could have a night of pool
at Jillian's... FREE ON THURSDAYS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS!  I am going to
call Jillian's about possibility of reserving some pool tables (or room
if available) for us to socialize and take turns playing pool.  If it's
going to cost something to reserve... then I'll go bargain hunting
around the city for the best price.

4) TRAMPOLINE FUN - Option of bouncing around type of fun at a local
gym.  If you all like this idea... then I can see to finding a gym with
a trampoline.

5) LASER TAG - Fun with laser guns (toys of course) as you get to shoot
at your friends and bigs (*grin*) for a day :o).  This is not something
you get to do everyday... and is open for  a possibility.  Unique fun
for us unique people :o)  Jo Tenczar is researching the details on this
activity.

Hmmm... well I think that's about all we have for now.  Those of you who
are a part of fellowship committee and wasn't able to attend the
meeting... please e-mail me your feedback or any additional ideas you
have of your own and  I would gladly add it on our list.  I just wanted
to get this out so you all know what's going on in the land of
fellowship and have time to think about it.

Thanks to our fellowship committee...

P.S. - Just to make sure everyone knows... night time (or early morning
shall i say) is not the only time i read e-mail.  I check it very
frequently during the daytime hours too :o).

Now I MUST sleep... later...

	For those of you who don't have my sig yet...  I will be in the
wedge today from about 4 to 4:30 or later.  If you need my sig, this is a
good time to get it.  If you can't come today, I'll be free on Thursday,
so email me.  Oh, and today I'll probably talk to you for about 10 minutes
or so, plan on hanging out for a little while.  Hope to see you then.	

Kristin

	Movie Night WILL be held this week, even though many people have
finals.  I hope you all will use this as a chance to unwind before or
after your finals.  We are going to choose the move by a vote when we all
get here.  We currently have a votes for Stargate, With Honors, and Air
Force One, but there are many other movies to choose from, so come and
cast your vote!  As always, we have plenty of food and drink.  For all you
pledges out there, this is a great opportunity to get to know some of the
Brothers and get those all important signatures.  We will be meeting in
the Wedge at 8:30 and the movie will probably be starting around 9:00.  I
hope to see you all!!!

Hi,
	YES! there will be a pledge meeting tonight at 9pm in HL 116. It
will start on time, so please don't be late. I know you all have to watch
southpark/ study for finals (probably in that order) so if we are all
there on time, we can all leave on time and get all our business taken
care of.

I would like to make tonights pledge meeting as short as possible.  I
understand that a lot of people still have a lot to do for Thursday.
Please take a few minutes and re-read the message that Jen Hardy sent
about the service ideas and the message that Colleen sent about the
fellowship ideas.  Then think about the ideas that we have already come up
with and think about any new ideas you might have.  Those will be the two
big issues we will be talking to you about.  Thanks.

Brian

Hi guys! 
    We just finished our first service meeting, and I want to bring you
all up to speed.  We have three ideas so far, but none have been
finalized yet.  We'll be talking more about these ideas on Wenesday, but
here is a preview:

Car Wash
   We would wash cars (as the name implies :) ) and donate the money to
a charity.  It would take place all day on a Saturday or Sunday.  We are
thinking March 28 or 29 or April 5.

Park Clean-Up
   We were thinking either Institute Park or the park near Price
Chopper.  It would bascially be picking up trash and other fun stuff.
It also would take place on a Saturday or Sunday, March 28 or March 29
or April 5.

Nursing Home Fun
     This is a little different from the other two.  We are thinking
about making a card or craft project one night here.  Then we would set
up several nights where we would go down and visit and socialize with
them or whatever they want us to do.  This way it wouldn't be an all day
commitment, rather two nights during the month of March.

None of these ideas are final or set in stone.  If anyone has any ideas,
call or email me!  This is our project, and we want as much input as we
can get!

Thanks to Brian Morgan, Tony Zamarro, Emily Reynolds, Joel Thibault,
Jenn Patoulidis, Andrea Emery, and Fred Tan for coming to the meeting
today :)

Hey, people :o)

Okay, there's one thing to be prepared for... lots of LATE e-mail from
me.  I am a WPI trained night owl :o).  (*sigh*)... sleep... the
forbidden pleasure :o).   ANYWAYS...  getting down to business.  We had
our first fellowship meeting tonight (or shall i say last night... okay
less confusing... mon. night).  And we came up with some *pretty kewl*
ideas, a whole variety to choose from :o).  As a committee, we wanted to
come up with events that would allow us as a pledge class to get to know
one another and the brothers as well.  These ideas listed below are just
"skeleton" ideas... I will hopefully have more details about some of
them for wednesday's pledge meeting.  So here we go...

1)  ROLLERSKATING - A favorite activity for people of *all* ages at a
nearby rink called Skylite.  We were especially interested in playing
80's music as a theme, but, of course that is open to question.  Just
think... all those that went to Orange Crush last friday... all that
fun... except now on roller skates!  This of course will cost money...
and I am going to call Skylite and get the scoop on costs and
possibility of reservations and what days available.
THEN... after skating... if on weekend... we can possibly enjoy a
SLUMBER PARTY!  (with pasta??... ask Tanya ;-).  Of course, a place to
hold this slumber party is negotiable... but we think that Founder's
basement would be a good place to hold it considering how many people
are in the pledge class and APO.

2) DANCE PARTY - We could enjoy a night of dancing to all kinds of
music. The provider for music is still up to question but there is a
possibility of having 94.5 or 95.5 DJ for us... BUT THIS IS STILL JUST
TALK... not for certain.   THEN... the slumber party option afterwards
like #1.

3) POOL - Many of us enjoy shooting pool.  We could have a night of pool
at Jillian's... FREE ON THURSDAYS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS!  I am going to
call Jillian's about possibility of reserving some pool tables (or room
if available) for us to socialize and take turns playing pool.  If it's
going to cost something to reserve... then I'll go bargain hunting
around the city for the best price.

4) TRAMPOLINE FUN - Option of bouncing around type of fun at a local
gym.  If you all like this idea... then I can see to finding a gym with
a trampoline.

5) LASER TAG - Fun with laser guns (toys of course) as you get to shoot
at your friends and bigs (*grin*) for a day :o).  This is not something
you get to do everyday... and is open for  a possibility.  Unique fun
for us unique people :o)  Jo Tenczar is researching the details on this
activity.

Hmmm... well I think that's about all we have for now.  Those of you who
are a part of fellowship committee and wasn't able to attend the
meeting... please e-mail me your feedback or any additional ideas you
have of your own and  I would gladly add it on our list.  I just wanted
to get this out so you all know what's going on in the land of
fellowship and have time to think about it.

Thanks to our fellowship committee...

shall i say) is not the only time i read e-mail.  I check it very
frequently during the daytime hours too :o).

Now I MUST sleep... later...

Hello everyone.  I hope that you are all having a nice finals week and you
aren't too stressed out.  I hope that everyone will have a relaxing break.

There were a few announcements made at the beginning of the meeting.  The
brother list is not available, as it is not yet complete.  It will be
handed out as soon as possible so your patience is appreciated.  If you are
going on the ski trip to Nila's house, you should have talked to her
already, and if you haven't, please do so.  There are a few last minute
details to work out.  Also, please contact Nila if your pledge pin is
faulty.  She will try to get you a new one if it is not working correctly.

We then moved on to discussing the Pledge Class Service Project.  We voted
on the three suggestions and placed them in the order of our preference. 
#1 is the car wash, #2 is the nursing home, and #3 is the park clean-up. 
The possible dates for the service project are March 29th and April 5th. 
If we do the car wash, we will try for March 29th, in case of bad weather. 
These three suggestions will be presented at the next brother meeting to be
voted upon by the brothers.

Next up on the agenda was discussion about the Pledge Class Fellowship
Project.  The majority of the pledge class chose the Roller-skating
suggestion.  This will be held on Friday, April 3rd, in the evening.  The
cost is not definitely known, it will depend on whether or not you need to
rent roller-skates.  

****Please Note:  Participation in these projects is mandatory.  Please
check your calendars NOW to see if you have any known conflicts.  If you do
find a problem with attending either project, please contact Matt Erickson
as soon as possible.

It was decided by a vote that there will be a Pledge Class Meeting on
Wednesday, March 11th, same place and time.  If you won't be back at school
yet or you have a conflict, please email Matt Erickson.  You will be
required to have at least one signature, but you are urged to get as many
as you can.

The details of the Pledge Class Sport will be discussed at our meeting on
March 11th, but we did decide upon a time and date.  The sport will be held
on Tuesday, March 17th at 6:00pm.

Well, that's it!  Good luck to everyone on finishing up the term.  Brooke

wanna see the cool full eclipse.. a) fly to the carribean b) log into
NASA's homepage) but it is the last eclipse this millenium to be seen in
the western hemisphere. and it still should be cool.

this has been a public service announcement by yusef and his 7 or 8 large
coffees (cannt remember at this point)

Please forgive me as I said "awesome job Brothers" in my Sleep out money
Email. I did not forget about those of you who raised money and helped
out. I just forget that you are pledges. You guys are too cool and I have
slept too little. but I appologize if you think I forgot you. I thanks you
much you also did a stupendous job and I don't know how it would have ever
gone off without you.

Thanks so much

If anyone has the book for EE3601 that took it this year, I'd be
interested in buying/borrowing it from you.  I have to take the class as a
requirement, but I really don't feel like paying the bookstore $90 for a
book I will never use after this term.   :)

So, if anyone can help me out...that'd be great.  The book is kinda
purple/blue....thanks!

Ben

	We are having Movie Night TONIGHT if there is anyone interested. 
We're even going to have it if nobody is interested.  We have rented "The
Game."  It's an excellent movie.  We are going to meet in the Wedge at
8:30 and start the movie around 9:00.  I hope everyone had a good break. 
See you tonight!!

 I hope that everyone had a nice break and you are all ready to start D
term!

We started off this evening with a funny name game, I think quite amusing
for most people!

We next moved on to updates from both Jen and Colleen about the Service and
Fellowship Projects.  The three options for service are going to be voted
upon by the brothers at the meeting next Monday.  As for fellowship, the
rollerskating (on 4/3) is going to cost $5 (including renting skates) per
person, and add $1 if you bring your own rollerblades.

It was decided by the pledges that the Pledge Class Sport is going to be
Capture the Flag (of course the rules are going to be changed by the
brothers!).  This is taking place March 17th at 6:00pm, that is, NEXT
TUESDAY!  George has volunteered to tell the brothers at the next meeting.

Announcement:  The brother list is now available!!

There was a pop quiz at the end of the meeting today.  The next one will be
on the APO toast song!!  So be prepared.

Good luck in all of your classes.

Brooke

Hi
	A few itens were left at my house after the ski trip.
A pair of women's lined jeans from the GAP. (Dibs if no one claims them!)
A bottle of shampoo 
a leather belt, brown.

	If any of these are yours, I'll bring them to the bro meeting on Monday.
Email me if you want to get them back sooner than that. 
thanks.

Hi guys and gals,
	I just wanted to remind you all to take a look at your list of
pledge requirements and refresh your memories. hint hint. Participating on
the service to students committee counts toward your committee
requirement. See you all on monday at the bro meeting.

Oh, one more thing. I promised to set up some big/little activities. And I
will. They will be announced at the next bro meeting if all goes well. 

Have a good weekend!
YiLFS,
Nila

Hi guys!
   Sorry for the short notcie on this, but I won't be able to make it
the brother meeting tonight (at least not until late).  I was wondering
if there was anyone who would be interested in presenting the three
project ideas to the brothers.  It doesn't have to be long or involved,
just tell them the basics, including date, time, ect.  If you are
interested, please email me back.  I can answer any questions and remind
you of all the info.

Thanks,
Jen

Everyone,

	My name is Linda Cappuccia.  I am the president of Alden Voices.
This weekend is our annual Cabaret and we need your help.  In the past
some of you have helped out considerable by working the ticket table or
refreshment table for us during the show (we can't do it since we will all
be on stage performing).  If any of you can help out again that would be
awesome.  The only reward I can offer you if free admission to an
excellent show.  If you would like to do both night that is great but if 
you can only do one night we will certainly understand.  It doesn't
require much of a time committment it is just this:

Friday: be there by 6:30 show starts at 7:30 and will be done by 9:30 the
latest.
Sunday: be there by 1:00 show starts at 2:00 and will be done by 4:00 the
latest.

Let me know if you can help us out.

Thank you,
Linda

OK, everyone, here's the latest news straight from the front.

At tonight's brother meeting:

1)Meeting was called to order at 6:37 PM
2)President Bruno explained Random Acts of Kindness 
3)SVP Grabowski told the brotherhood about upcoming meetings and events,
esp. Dance-A-Thon
4)MVP Almstrom told the brotherhood about upcoming Big/little events
5)FVP Jucius  told the brotherhood about upcoming fellowship events, esp.
the ones this week
6)Jo Tenczar presented the pledge class's choices for the pledge class
service project
7)Brotherhood voted in favor of the car wash
8)Committee meetings and other upcoming events were explained
9)Kim Sargent told a good joke
10) We sang (off-key...)
--------------------------------------------------
DETAILS!!

2) Random Acts of Kindness are spontaneous or planned service
mini-projects benefiting the campus or the community.  You can call
brother(s) and/or pledge(s) up, say, "Hey, you, I'm gonna clean up the
trash on highland". and go do it.
The idea is to get everyone involved in little things that are, well,
RANDOM!  The first such event will be Thursday at 4PM.  Meet in the
Wedge.  What we'll be doing is, of course, to be determined.

3) Upcoming service events:
  - D term blood drive- I've forgotten the dates, but talk to Matty G.
    about this
  - Dance-a-thon is April 18th and Joe Hausmann needs volunteers to help
    him with it

Hi all you pledges out there,
	Chris send us a very jampacked email this week. I'd like to advise
you all to keep that message around, don't just delete it. This way you
have it around when you need to refer to it. So, there's no excuse for not
knowing when sercom meets, it's right in the newsletter. Just a friendly
reminder from your neighborhood MVP.  :)

Ok pledges I have one ticket to Conclave. The first person that wants to
go who is not yet going whom emails me back wins this ticket and a chance
to drive 7 hours in a car with the brotherhood. If you are first you get
it. This is binding and all decistions made by matt grabowski are final.
Any speling errors are due to lack of sleep and an inate dissability to
in the speling domain of my brain. 

Thanks,
mattyg

	Back by popular demand is Tuesday Movie Night.  We will also be
having movie night on Friday.  Come to one, or both, if you dare.  We
already have one request for Friday's Movie.  Email me if there is
anything you want to see and we'll find a way to get it.  For both nights,
we will be meeting in the wedge at 8:30 and the movie will be starting
around 9:00.

	FelComm is going to be Tuesday at 4:30 before the pledge sport.  I
hope to see a lot of you there so we can plan some really awesome
activities for the rest of the term.  We will be meeting in the Wedge.

	On Saturday, we will be having a Game night.  We are hoping all of
you that are not going to Conclave will be there for some exciting games
of Mindtrap, Monopoly, or whatever game you choose to bring.  It will be a
fun time.  We will be ironing out all the details during Felcomm.

ReCap:

Tuesday 4:30 Felcomm in the Wedge

	8:30 Meet in Wedge for Movie Night

Friday 8:30 Meet in Wedge for Movie Night, email me movie requests.

can't play on it, but I need names to fill out the roster.

   Hi folks,

   due to a lack of interest (most likely because everyone's going to
conclave) in game night this weekend, it has been cancelled for this date.
It is now tentatively planned for wednesday April 15. this is the day
before project presentation day. There will be a sign-up list at the next
brother meeting to find out how many are interested. If you can volunteer
your place to hold it please let me know on the sheet.


    Yilfs,
   Matt Shaw

I would like to thank you all for the response to my offer for helping

few people I had to go on a first come first serve basis (I am assuming
many of you REALLY want the free ticket).  So here are the names:

HI,	
	There have been a number of people who asked me to set-up an event
so bigs and littles have something to go to together and do, sociallize
and have fun. SO! I did that. I reserved the gym for tommorrow night from
9-11. So call up your big or little and go play some ball in Harrinton.
This isn't to have bros compete against pledges like the sport, or to
compete in big/little pairs...necessarily. Just an opportunity to call
your big or little and say hey, let's go do something.  Even if you don't
play basketball that well, there will be some basketball orientated games
that don't necessarily involve so many skills. 

Nila

Hi everyone.  I hope that everyone's week is going well.

We started off the evening with another quiz.  This one was on the Toast
Song, so I hope that everyone is practicing it (hint, hint)!!

Then, just a few reminders:
	-There will be both the Big/Little Olympics and the Lock-In on March 28th.
 (The 	Olympics should be starting around 4:00 and last up to an hour and a
half.)
	-The Car Wash is coming up on the 29th, probably from 2-9.
	-Rollerskating is coming up on April 3rd.
	-There is Basketball tomorrow (Thursday) from 9-11pm in Harrington
Auditorium.

We brainstormed and voted for where the money from the Car Wash is going to
be donated.  It was determined that we are going to give the money to a
local Battered Woman's Shelter.  A specific place is being looked into.

Then we broke into Service and Fellowship Committees to discuss the details
of our pledge projects.  You should be hearing from the committee heads if
you are needed to do something ahead of time for the projects.

Have a nice rest of the week!!

Brooke

Well, as you probably know by know, and should be told multiple times
anyway, the Pledge Class Fellowship Committee (PCFC) is holding a
roller-skating party on April 3rd.  Could anyone that could possibly
provide transportation to and from, preferably by automobile, mail me back
as soon as is convenient?  Also, if you have a friend who might be
interested in going, feel free to invite them.  If they have a car, even
better!  Thanks a lot, 'cuz even people without wheels like to skate!

Just for clarification, I may not have made this clear.  Non APO brothers
and pledges should not be invited to the pledge classe fellowship project.
This is an oportunity for us to grow together as an organization and
although we do allow non-brothers to participate in many things this is
not one of them.  

Also if you wish to send e-mail to the brothers the address is
"aponews@wpi.edu", apo@wpi is only read by Mike our mighty president.

Yes, you are correct.  I'm sorry about that, I guess I reversed it.  It
should be 9-2.

Thought you'd get a chuckle out of this.  (It was forwarded to us by
Marti Smith of Caleb Project.)

A man was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and
said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."  He bent
over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket.  The frog spoke up
again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful
princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you
are my hero."  The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it,
and returned it to his pocket.  The frog spoke up again and said, "If
you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will be your
loving companion for an entire week."  The man took the frog out of his
pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket.  The frog then
cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay
with you for a year and do ANYTHING you want."  Again the man took the
frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket.  Finally, the
frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess,
that I'll stay with you for a year and do anything you want.  Why won't
you kiss me?"  The man said, "Look, I'm an engineer.  I don't have time
for a girlfriend, but a talking frog is cool."

Hey, how's it goin?

Just a message to you all on the lastest in the pledge class fellowship
project (rollerskating).   Well as I mentioned it is going to be on
Friday April 3 from 7-11pm at a rollerskating rink called Skylite on
Park Ave.  The cost is going to be $5 per person including rentals (that
is group rate).  However, if you plan on bringing your own rollerblades
then the cost will be $6 instead.  Don't ask me why it costs an extra
buck... i guess they just have ridiculous business strategies.
Anyhow... if you are bringing rollerblades, the only thing they ask is
that if your rollerblades have bolts on the sides where the wheels are
held together, then tape it up or something so it doesnt scratch their
floor.  At any rate, I am going to collect the money ahead of time.
This means that anytime starting after I get back from conclave, you
need to give me your money for the event.  I am going to be creating a
checklist (bros and pledges) so i know who paid, who is going, and if
you are bringing rollerblades or not.   Obviously, this event is
mandatory for all pledges, but brothers are given the option of joining
in on this great fun.  But the next issue to cover is...
transportation.  As some of you know, jon sent out an email regarding
this but i will mention it again because unfortunately he left out the
brothers.   We NEED drivers.  So, what i would like from you is...
1) if you have a car and willing to provide transport to and from
2) how many people you can take
The sooner you give me this information the better.  Jon (joexner) is
helping me out with this organizing so you can email him or me...
whatever you prefer.  Like Matt made clear... NON-APO BROS OR PLEDGES
ARE TO BE INVITED.  Hmmm... i think that is it for now and i MUST be
going to bed now (me sleepy)... later.

	For all of you who are not going to Conclave, we will be having a
movie night.  We haven't decided on a movie, but if you have one you want
to see, then bring it and we'll put it to a vote when we get here.  It'll
be a fun time like always.  We will be meeting in the Wedge at 8:30 and
the movie will probably start around 9:00.  I hope to see you here!

Hi everyone!
   I hope your weekend is going well, and that you are all prepared for
the snow :)

   For those of you who don't know, this year's spring pledge class has
decided to run a car wash as the service project.   The proceeds are
going to a battered women's shelter here in Worcester.  It will run from
9-2 on March 29 at the Mobil Station on the corner of Park Ave.

   I have lots of important announcements about the car wash.  I need
lots of help getting this all together, so please email me back as soon
as possible with what you can bring or help help out with.  This way I
will know exactly what we have and what's being done.  (And if I don't
get it, I can harass all of you via email.)

1 - We need lots of buckets and sponges.  I am planning on buying some
sponges, but sponges always seem to disappear at car washes.  So bring
whatever you have.

2 - Tony Z. mentioned trying to find a shammy (is this spelled right?)
or two to maybe dry the cars.  I seriously doubt that anyone has one in
their room, but if you live around here and have one at home that would
be great.

3 - We need banner paper to make signs to hang on the fence at Mobil.
Matt told me that Socomm has some that they give out.  He said that Sean
Dunn was our connection.  Would someone be willing to hunt this down?

4 - We decided that the lockin would be a great time to make signs for
the car wash since we'll all be there.  Paint would be the best thing
for the smaller signs (which we'll be using to run around with that
day), and spray paint would be ideal for the banner.  Does anyone have
some?

5 - We have decided that making a donation box for people to put money
would be the best way to go.  People always seem to be more generous
that way.  And we can't give out change.  It doesn't have to be anything
fancy, but it should probably say WPI APO and tell where the proceeds
are going.  This could be done at the lockin, if someone brings a box
and a creative idea.

   I think that's about it.  I'll be buying some car wash soap, since
some people are picky.  Please let me know if anybody can do any of
these things.

   Questions, comments, and concerns are welcome.

Thanks,
Jen Hardy

Jen,
	This is Tony's idea but since he din't write it in I am.
Recently, a new auto parts/supplies store opened up on Park Ave accross
from Baybank and I'm sure they'd love to donate the supplies we need if we
put their name on our banner, especially since the  money we raise is
going to a charity.  I think we should look into this before anyone buys
anything.
	I don't have time this week to do this but all someone has to do
is get down to the place and ask them and maybe write out a formal letter
afterwards just for the stores records.  Whoever goes can ask them what to
put in the letter.  
-Jen:)

	Unfortunately, I forgot to mention several things af the meeting
tonight.  First of all, I am planning to have Felcomm at 4:30 tomorrow in
the Wedge.  If you signed up for the Lockin committee, that will most
likely be the main subject of the meeting.  We will be having two movie
nights this week as well.  The movie for Tuesday is The Usual Suspects.
The movie for Friday will probably be decided upon when we get there.  If
you want squares for the NCAA pool, see me ASAP for the best selection.
The halftime winner will get $17 and game-ending winner will get $33.
Squares are only 50 cents a piece and each square has two chances to win.
I will keep the people on the Lockin Committee informed on any meeting
times.  Also, I will be emailing people about the Revolution Tickets.  I
will be ordering them this week, so keep your eyes peeled for the email.
If you are not on the list but are interested, email me ASAP.

Schedule:

Tuesday:
	4:30 Felcomm in the Wedge
	8:30 Meet in Wedge for Movie Night
	9:00 Start "The Usual Suspects"

Friday:
	8:30 Meet in Wedge for Movie Night

Saturday:
	Lockin - TBA

	We have four soccer games the next four Sundays.  All of the games
are played on the turf and we need at least 7 people to play.  Games start
on the hour (in theory).  It'll be a fun season For those of you
interested in the floor hockey schedule, they are making it up today.  For
the intramural teams, we invite and encourage everyone interested to play.
We never have too many people and you can play both sports if you want. 
We are in the recreational league, not the competative league.  Our goal
is to have fun above all else.  I hope to see many of you at the games!! 

Intramural Soccer Schedule:

3/28/1998 3:00pm APO vs. ATO 2

4/5/1998  3:00pm APO vs. FIJI B

4/12/1998 2:00pm APO vs. SAE 2

4/19/1998 4:00pm APO vs. ATO 2

	Matt

P.S. for those of you interested in softball, we unfortunately did not
have enough interest to submit a team roster.

Hi all,


	I have also found that I cannot use my Icecats tickets tonight as
I have developed a cold.  If you would like them, I have 2.  E-mail or
call before 6 because the game starts at 7:05.  

Later all,

Burzycki

HI Everyone!
	Lots of you need to take a visit to the office and get my sig.
So here's what I'm going to do. I'll take anyone who needs to go to the
office still tonight at 7:00 pm. Meet me outside of the PH building. If
you are late just go to the stair case nearest the Chemistry building in
Olin and go all the way to the top. That's where well be.
	As far as my sig., if you eat at Daka and you happen to spot me,
please come feel free to join me. If this is doesn't work for you than we
can arrange another time to talk such as during the lock in. I hope that
you all are enjoying your pledge period and I look forward to calling you
brothers. 
							Mike

HI Everyone!
	Opps... I forget that housing selection was tonight. I will be
going at 7 still. And I will be going at 4 on Friday as well. If neither
of these times work for you than we'll work something out during the
lock-in.

	We have our first floor hockey game tonight at 7:00.  We need
people there.  From the people I talked to, I'm not sure we'll have enough
to play, so if you can make it, I would really appreciate it.  The game is
at 7:00 in Alumni.  If you could be there at 6:30, that would be great.
Thanks a lot.

HI all, 
	since the weather is so nice, the olympics will be held on higgins
lawn, if by some chance it is either raining or cold tommorrow (or
higgins lawn is being used), we still have the basement of founders. don't
forget that if you said you would bring something, we are depending on you
to bring it. OK I won't bother you anymore. Enjoy the nice weather. 

Nila

hey guys!!  i was talking to matt about the upcoming pledge quiz (AGH!!) 
:)  he told me that there is usually a study session to help prepare
worried pledges.  i was wondering if people want to get together tomorrow
after the brother meeting to look at some stuff he has for us to study
from.  that would be around 7:30 or 8 ish.  if this is terribly
inconvenient for a bunch of people, we can try for a different time!  just
let me know!!

	We have a game tonight at 7:00 in Alumni.  I talke to Pres. Bruno,
and he says that people can leave the brother meeting early  if they would
like to play.  I encourage anyone who can make it to play.  Also, remember
that   the Final Four basketball party is tonight at my place after the
brother meeting.  Buy your squares now!  You don't have to be there to
win.  50 cents gets you two chances to win.  See everyone at the meeting
tonight.

Hi y'all,

   I just wanted to thank all of you who particpated in the Car Wash
yesterday.  I don't know about you, but I thought it was lot of fun and
a tremendous success.  We raised a lot of a considerable amount of money
for only 5 hours worth of work.  I am going to see if someone from the
Youville House will come to one of the brother meetings to talk a little
about the house.  When I talked to the woman, she said that they could
definately use the money (especially with Easter right abound the
corner).

See you tonight!

Jen Hardy

brother meeting, as planned, and the other will be tomorrow evening,
around the same time (8 pm) at a location to be announced.  :)
thanks guys!

	Just wanted to let all of you know that there will be a massage
program in the wedge tomorrow night.  It will be run by a professional
massage teacher who will be doing a demo on techniques etc...  all are
welcome...  you may want to bring a pillow and blanket for comfort... and
a partner would be good too...  
	Relieve stress... relax... Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. in the Lower
Wedge.

There will be no SerComm this week for two reasons.

1.  I need a Job!
1.5 We can do it next week without problems.
2.  I am making myself available for sigs.

Hey pledges,

If you need my sig I reside in Gompies from 11:30 to 12:20 every day of
the week and longer on Wednesday, (not twice on Sundays). So if you need
my sig I am there then. One thing though, Tuesday is already taken so you
will either have to find me later in the day or later in the week. (But be
warned you need my sig by monday or else we hang you by your toes or
somethin like that. I forget exactly how it goes.

Ok See ya,

mattyg

Matty G was mistaken.  He said you need his sig by Monday, but sig sheets
are due Friday!

	Hello My friends!

	My apologies for missing Monday's meeting...I have a class on
Monday's now--PQP thought it would be cool to double our workload and have
two long days of classes instead of only one!

	In any event, I need some help--PLEASE, *PRETTY PLEASE*, somebody
return my Cayenne Pepper (The baggie of really red hot stuff!!)  I left it
in the kitchen!  Also I left a dish and a spoon, and I hope somebody
finished the jar of salsa!  Also there was a block of cheese in the fridge
I hope somebody got.  If you have the salsa or cheese, keep it if you
want.  But, I'd like the dishes, and the pepper, PLEASE!  I can only get
that spice back home (in TX)!

	Thanks!
	Here's your Joke-- (a modified version of Nila's joke)

[pleasantly] surprise her husband.  So, she stopped at the langere shop
and picked out a deep red, revealing piece of clothing.  She rushed home,
and pulled into the driveway.  She changed <in the car> into her new
bought langere and went into the house and climbed softly up the stairs.
Her long flowing blonde hair had just been done that day and she knew her
husband would be excited to see her!
	As she burst into the room, she yelled " SURPRISE! "...and that it
was!  To her horror she discovered that her surprised husband was in bed
with another woman!  In her fury she ran over to the bureau and pulled the
pistol out of the drawer and pointed it at her temple.  Her husband cried
"NO!  Don't do it!!!"  
	The young woman retorted-- "Don't worry-- YOUR NEXT!"

        Richard Donovan, Section 96 Chair
Subject: "Things Disappearing"

    Things are quickly getting out of hand. <fact>

    UHauls? Mercenary Raids until you get something "good"?  Shenanigans to
get stuff back that get people sick? Ceasing to inform people of chapter
events because there "loyalty" is  suspect? Stealing from elderly women?
(all of these are facts)

    We're not stealing things in plain sight anymore, we're going into
locked offices sometimes by stealing keys, other times by climbing in
windows in the night.

    The point of this originally was fellowship NOT war... you know like the
point was for people to like get to know each other and become friendlier?
Not come to fear other chapters visiting... and have to put guard and locks
on things that they don't want to disappear.

    The attitude in 94 AND 96 will clean up in the next 24 hours as I am
ending things disappearing before:
    a) someone gets hurt
    b) someone gets arrested
    c) someone creates a lot of hurt feelings and bad blood
    Yes this means that all the disappeared things will be returned. (There
is no choice here) AND new things will NOT be disappearing. Yes, I'm ruining
some fun, and it's no fun for me to be a spoil sport.

    It's also no longer fun for me either to hear the complaints and have to
deal with arrange the resolutions.  Let me give you one example out of many
of how I things are getting out of  hand and why I can no longer turn a
blind eye to things:

    On checking off of the State of Maine on Conclave Weekend I had more
baggage than I could carry. So with the Chapter's permission I left some in
my cabin to come back and get. The baggage that was left behind was rifled
through, and things were stolen form inside my bags. Have I gotten a ransom?
nope... Guess I'm just supposed to do with out until someone gets around to
returning things.
    Someone was watching me (stalking is another good word here) waiting
until my back was turned, went into a closed cabin, and rifled through
packed things searching for something. In the real world I would have called
the Hancock County Sheriff and reported a B&E.

    So let's do an attitude check here, and remember that we are a
BROTHERHOOD. Let's further take a look at what our brotherhood is
grounded on, the 12 points of the scout oath, one of which is TRUST.

    Also I'll throw one final thought out to you all to give you an
underpinning as to why I am acting.  If someone doesn't want to play,
doesn't know the rules ahead of time, and has no opportunity to readily get
there stuff back then;

Humiliation could be a form of hazing.
Fear could be a form of hazing.
Forcing people to do without necessities could also be a form of hazing.

and I think we are getting to that point where could be changes to "is"

Hey Everyone.

Ok I got a bit of confused email about an emial from John Grossi
concerning stealing things. First let me clarify who John is.
He is the Section Chair for section 94 (NH, VT, ME, and Quebec). He is
also an alumni of our chapter. (You should remember since he is the guy
who got the only DSK we have ever given out as a chapter, It's on every
pledge quiz. Hint hint: Tell your little) Ok so that is John.

Now this steeling thing is a tradition that MMA is most famous for
promoting. With each visit to another chapter brothers will steel
something from that chapter to get the other chapter to come to them and
either do something humiliating to get it back or just steel it back. As
of the last few conclaves and Sectionals that i have been at the thing to
steel has been the gavel. Well since OI is not the most active at
interchapter relations noone but regular conclave goers and Yusef have
ever really known anything about the steeling traditions that have gone
on. 

Most recently the gavel was stollen from Mrs. T, whom is MMA's oldest
and most beloved advisor. For her many years of service to Phi Epsilon
Chapter, the Chapter gave her a gavel and well it was stolen durring
conclave. Lots of bad timing and unhappy people arose from this incident
and well now Umass is on bad terms with MMA. This is just one incident
though and this steeling thing has become too much. After the Mrs. T
incident and the steeling of items from John Grossi's baggs there has been
an order to halt all such activity as it has gotting out of hand very
quickly. Breaking into locked offices and closets, etc is the reason for
stopping it.

So since OI is not into this stuff we are fine. Hence why noone had any
idea what that email was about. So just don't be steeling from Umass or
anyone else if you go visit other chapters. This is the jist of the
letter that yall need to know.

If you have other questions emial me or you can go to the source
jgrossi@bbnplanet.com to get more information. 

Thanks, 
mattyg

Hi, Everyone!

	As you all know, Acapellafest is this Saturday.  A group of us
were thinking of all going together.  If you're interested, just meet in
the wedge at 6:15 Saturday evening, as the show starts at 7:00.  However,
you must BUY YOUR OWN TICKETS for this.  Tickets are $4 for WPI students,
and will be on sale starting tomorrow in the mail room.  Tickets will also
be sold at the door, but to insure that you will be able to get in, it
would be a good idea to buy one ahead of time.  
	So, get your tickets early and show up Saturday in the wedge at
6:15.  We will probably head over around 6:30.  It will be a lot of good
music, so I hope you can all make it!!!

Send this Tonight. \Tuesday\ 
Movie sugestions need to be sent to Josh Cloutier (poolman@)
email him with movies that you would like to see that are at leaste two
years old. (We want to keep cost of the movies down.)
Send this Tonight. \Tuesday\

Otherwise we need
8 to 10 volunteers to do donations at the door.
Some more Boxes to put the donations in.
Someone to drive the stuff down to Worcester County Food Bank.

Ok that is all that I can see for now. If there is anything else I will

Hi pledges,
	One of the pledges wrote and said she had some concerns about the
whole voting thing and why. Many of you are worried bout requirements and
that if you haven't filled them that you won't get voted in and that you
just can't take the rejection. 
	So here's what I suggest to maximize your chances.
1 look at the list of requirements and see if you are all done. Maybe you
forgot to tell me what you did, or aren't sure if what you did counts. SO
ASK!!! explain what you did and I'll tell you if it's good or not. Besides
that I can check that against my records. 

2 think about what you want to say for yourself during the voting. In the
past we haven't said anything but names, just to make sure bros remember
the faces, but we felt that you should be able to say more on your behalf.
HINT say positive things. try to speak clearly and act like you are taking
this voting thing seriously. I know it is nerve wracking I went through
all this aniexiety once. We are trying to make it easyier.

If you missed more meetings than you were allowed, it needs to be excused
by memcomm. Now we don't just excuse everyone without good reason. SO if
there was a good reason, tell me soon cuz memcomm is tommorrow at 3:30. If
you have already arranged something because you say work at 6:30- on
mondays, then you are all set.

Ok the purpose of all this was to help you out and not be so worried about
everything.  I hope it helped. email me if you have concerns and I'll talk
to you. If you want, talk to me at the pledge meeting tomorrow.


YiLFS,
Nila

Hey folks,

I have been noticing and hearing talk about people not knowing when things
are happening and stuff so I am going to send you this little email to let
you after my developing page of events that we and or brothers are
involved in. It is a schedual on the APO Website (Yes we have one) that is
under my service schedual. Just go to the page and check it for dates and
times of important stuff. I have it right through the end of April so I
think most everything is on there except some regular meetings. 

The page is http://www.wpi.edu/~apo/service.html

Ok If you have any ideas to improve it just email mattg and they will get
added.

Hi Everyone!
	I just wanted to drop you all a quick note congratulating you on
the terrific service project that you put together. I realize that it's
crunch time now and that a few of you are finding it hard to do everything
you've got to.  Hang in there! All the brothers are behind you  and would
be glad to help you any way possible. I can't tell you how excited we all
are to have such an awesome group coming into apo. We are all looking
forward to making you brothers. So just hang in there, do as much as you
can and your efforts will be noted. Again, if any of you have any
questions or concerns feel free to contact myself or another brother. We
all want to make the transition from pledge to brother as smooth as
possible for you. Well good luck to you all.
							Mike

Hi Everyone!
	Well as many of you know the pledge process will soon be coming to
pivotal point. We are voting very soon, the pledge class fellowship
project is this Friday, and the all important induction is only a couple
of weeks down the road. This is a great pledge class. Many of the people
in it have immense potential and that is why as brother's it is our
responsibility to show them our support. We must show them that we are
taking an active interest in their pledge class, and that we support them
100%. APO needs its brothers to do this, and so I would ask that everyone
attend as many things as possible. A scheduled list of events will be sent
out asap. Your support of this chapters actions is critical, and I thank
you for it in advance.
						Sincerely,
						Michael Bruno

Hi Everyone,
	If you've sent me a time, you're fine. If you haven't sent me a
time yet than please send me a time that you can show up between 7&10 (in
fifteen minute blocks) i.e. 7:45 or 9:15
	Pictures will be taken in Founders Country Kitchen ( same place we
were in last weekend). It's really important that we get everyone to come
so if you know of a brother who hasn't signed up for a spot get there
case. Thanks

If anyone could help me study for the coming pledge quiz, it would be
greatly appreciated.  My # is 6895, and I'll probably be in my room 'till
the meeting.

. Sorry to bug everyone with a mass reply, but I figure that it's best if
everyone gets this.

. I would suggest that for the last minute cram session, we do it in
Higgins so that everyone can try and make it.  People should go whether
they are prepared (so that they can help the other people) or if they still
have to cram.

. I know that Froot is having a Service to Students meeting at 8:15pm in
HL116, but we can just meet outside and help each other study.

YiLFS,
Frederick Tan

P.S. I'll try and be there as soon as I can, but I'm coming from Clark for
Special O.

Congradulations  Everyone passed the quize and there were a whole lot of
scores over 100%.  It was a very impressive showing.  I think what is even
more impressive is the way you all helped each other study and prepare
Good work I will see you around.

I too want to say how cool it was that everyone did so well and worked
together. it says a lot about how great your pledge class is. SOme of you
have some pledge requirements to work on, but we are all set on that and
you hopefully aren't worried about if you have your requirements done or
not. I hope I was able to clear up any confusion about that tonight. 
I am pretty psyched about my first class getting initiated. yeah!!! you
all are awesome. by the way I was looking for the study group last night
and I couldn't find it.

then if you havent already put in my mail box or given it to me.  Hope
this helps!  I will e-mail later today about detailed info on tomorrow's
event.  Bye...

Colleen,

I sprained my ankle on Tuesday at track practice, so I will not be able to
rollerskate on Friday.  I still plan on going and hanging out, but I am
curious whether or not I still have to pay the $5 because I won't be
renting skates.  I'm writing this to everyone, because I'm not sure if
there are going to be other people who don't want to or can't skate.
Thanks.

Okay.. just a reminder for everyone.  Rollerskating, that is the pledge
class fellowship project, is tonight at Skylite from 7-11pm.  Rides will
be provided.  As far as assignment of rides, i will make a list and
divide you all up tonight.  Please just dont show up and pay at the door 
since you will not get the group rate and I would like to keep all of us 
together.  We are meeting in the wedge at 6:30 tonight... dont worry i
wont leave without anyone if i know you are going (that is, you have given
me money or sent me an e-mail letting me know otherwise).  Hmmm...
anything else??  Well, i think that's all i have to say for now.. but if
any of you have any concerns or questions... please feel free to e-mail
me.  But now i must go... hope to see alot of you tonight cuz we are gonna
boogie!  Later..

HI 
	Pledge voting is going to be held at the next meeting on Monday.
It is extremely important that all of the active brothers attend so we can
make quorum and vote, and for the pledges to come and show their face.

	The voting will take some time and we don't want to rush it because 
this vote will very much affect the future of APO.  So please
plan for the meeting to run a little long. Just so we aren't there all
night, we'll try to keep the rest of the meeting as concise as possible.

YiLFS,
Nila

P.S. For those of you who missed it, the rollerskating was a blast!

Hi pledges,
	I haven't counted yet, but I know I don't have 23 sig sheets yet.
If you haven't turned yours in yet, I'll be at the easter basket making
party and you can turn them in there. Even if you aren't done, it is
better to turn it in now and and be missing a few sigs than a whole sheet.
The reason I need the sig sheets today is that I have to make the ballots
for the voting tommorrow. Have a good rest of the weekend everyone. :)

I know you're all looking forward to boogying your brains out at the DAT,
but there is a lot of work to be done that night, and I need people to be
willing to take time to help out.  Here's what I need:
* 4 people to help with the setup of the video stuff (with the pros) from
  4-10
* 4 people to help them take everything down from 2-3am
* 2 people at the refreshment table at all times to make sure nothing gets
  spiked and to make sure it stays stocked (1 hour shifts fron 8pm to 2am)
* 2 people to man the front door for ID check and money collection (in shifts)

Please e-mail me telling me how you'd like to help out.  Don't worry,
there will be plenty of time left for fun when your work is done.

YiLFS,
Jo

hello,
	Don't forget that we are VOTING on the pledges tonight. It is very 
important that you come and vote. We need everyone there. The meeting will
take a little longer, so plan ahead. But for your convienience we will
VOTE FIRST and do our other business after. Many members of the pledge
class have worked very hard this semester and it would be nice if we
showed then that we appreciate that by being there for the whole time so
everyone has an equal chance. 
Thanks.
Nila

As Joe said I would, I am sending out another mail for those of you who
deleted my first mail (and I am very deeply hurt that you just deleted my
mail.).  Those of you who did - you know who you are!  Once again, we
need:
*  2 people an hour at the refreshment table from 8pm to 2am
*  10 people for security (also in 1 hour shifts).  This includes checking
ID's at the front door, as well as various posts around the gym to make
sure people don't go where they're not supposed to go.  We're also going
to have some fraternity boys helping out with this, but they can't do it
all!
*  2 more people to help Turning Circles set up the video screens, lights,
etc... from 4 to 10pm.
*  3 more people to help them take it all apart from 2am to 3am.
*  2 people every hour from 8pm to midnight to collect money from the
people coming in.

If you already e-mailed me telling me what you want to do, you don't need
to write to me again, unless you want to sign up for more stuff.  Everyone
else, sign up please!  We have a lot that needs to be done.  You really
will still be able to have fun if you take time out to work.  I promise!

well the voting came in and your beloved George "of the Jungle" Court
Jester, didn't quite make it (maybe i shouldn't have used one of my bad
jokes for my two minute speech), but don't be downhearted, never fear! 
I will be a pledge again in the fall (who knows, one of you might even
end up being my Big.  how often does that happen getting to be a Big of
someone who was in the same pledge class as you).  Of course i'll expect
you all to show up when they vote in the fall, and say wonderful things
about me, and vote me in, otherwise i will have to pledge again and i
think three times would just be way too many.  oh well, congrats to you
all, and see you all around!  :)

I hate to back out of the time I signed up for, but I'm really sick.  If
someone could fill in for me for wedge recruiting from 1:30-2:30 and 2:30
cleanup, I'd really appreciate it.  That way I can go down to health
services then.  If no one can do it, I'll still wedge sit, but I'd rather
not. Sorry for the inconvenience.

YiLFS,
Jo

P.S. - Congrats to all the other new brothers!  =)

Hey 

If you signed up to work at the movie tonight then be there about 8:00 or
8:10. If you are sick or something stay in bed. If you just want to watch
the last crusade then bring a buck or a canned good. Perralt Hall. 8:30

	I am looking for someone to sublet my room for the summer.  If
anyone is interested or if you know anyone that might be, please let me
know!  It is a nice apartment with A/C, a dishwasher, garbage disposal,
and it keeps it's well insulated, so it isn't sweltering!  Let me know!
Thanks!

Grabowski for details.
------------------------------------------------------
Details:

2) The faculty variety show is for the enjoyment of the students.  At the
show we expect to have faculty members demonstrating various cool things
they can do.  For example, singing, dancing, making cool chemicals that
produce neat smoke, bodybuilding,etc. They are encouraged to perform in
groups.  The main issue is how to attract the faculty to participate.  If
we charge a small admission fee (~$1) and donate the money to a charity of
the choice of the winner (of the best/worst act), we will probably get
plenty of faculty to participate.  The problem is that we will be charging
the students for yet another event, something that the executive committee
feels we should reduce (that is, events that require money to
participate).  
	One alternative proposed is to not charge for the event, and get
SAO and/or other organizations to donate a gawdy trophy to be awarded to
the winner.  This would attract some faculty for humor, and to help start
a tradition (the trophy could be handed down, much like the goat head).
The problem is that we might not attract as many faculty as a charity
event.
	Another issue is when to hold it.  Originally, the plan was to
hold the event during Parents' Day weekend, so that parents would bring
their students along to see the faculty goof off.  However, that is
probably not possible, because Parents' Day weekend is apparently
completely planned.  
	So, we need ideas from the brotherhood about these, and any other
issues that I missed, so that we can plan this event together.  Please
don't flood the mailing list; send ideas to (apo@wpi.edu).  Thanks!

3) Matt Grabowski needs spray paint.  Let him know if you have any you can
donate.

4) Nila Almstrom would like all the big brothers from the just-completed
pledge period to email her and tell her things that you did or did not
like, as well as ideas for improvement.  The next Memcomm will be devoted
to discussion of improvement of the pledge and big/little program.

5) For information on events, see the APO web page
(http://www.wpi.edu/~apo).

Duly entered,
Chris

mini-golf at Lighthouse Mini-Golf in Northboro.  It is $5.00 a person per
round or $4.50 if we have 10 people or more.  I hope everyone can drag
themselves out of bed in time after the DAT.  If you have a car, PLEASE
bring it.


Where:  Wedge
When: Noon Sunday
What to bring: Transportation if you have it
How much: $5.00 per round or $4.50 if we have enough people.  I know I
will want to play at least a couple rounds. 

See everyone later!
        Matt

Greetings,

. If anyone has misplaced a Minolta AF101R camera with a roll of ASA400
film, I have it.  It was left behind the refreshment stands among all of
the bookbags.

. Let me know if it's yours or you know who's it is.

	We will have our final Intramural soccer game today (Sunday) at
4pm. on the turf.  I hope to see a lot of people there.  If the team we
are supposed to play doesn't show up, we will be making up last week's
game with AXP, so we WILL have someone to play against this week.  Don't
forget mini-golf at noon, too.
	Matt

Forgot that the Big Soccer Game is today at 4:00 so we will be doing
supper Secret stuff at 5:00 directly after the soccer game for an hour or
two depending on the number of people that come.

This will probably be the last organized Super Secret Big Thing Session.
So it is important that we get things Done.

TODAY 5:00 - in MORGON DINNING ROOMS(next to Daka)

	Today (Sunday) at 4:00 in Founders Country Kitchen, Tau Beta Pi is
hosting an engineering futures session open to the entire campus.  These
sessions are fun seminars that teach important leadership skills (plus I
think in the one today you get to play with tinker toys!)  Pizza and
drinks will be provided. 

I hope to see some of you there!

Did anyone happen to pick up the roll of duct tape we were using at the
Dance-A-Thon?  It was my roommate's and she's been hounding me to get her
tape back.

Sorry to abuse the aliases like this, but I am in a desperate search.

Due to some difficult circumstances, my Costa Rica IQP plans are not going
to work out.  I am now in hot pursuit of an interested partner to complete
an IQP 2/3 E term and 1/3 A term with Professor Chrys Demetry.  If you or
someone you know and trust is a good worker, are looking to complete an
IQP over the summer term, please let me know.  Get in contact with me
asap and I'll explain the details, you can then decide if you're
interested.
I am attempting to reach as many people as possible and I don't have much
time.  Pass this email onto any one who crosses your mind as a potential
match.  Make it one big chain letter.  If I get it back, I know that means
it's working.  If you have any suggestions send them my way.  Thanks so
much.  


Sincerely, 
Leigh

Hi all

I was asked to send out a formal email to everyone explaining what is
needed in a Dance A Thon Chair.

Here are the basic criteria: 
1. You need to be able to organize many people and plan in advance.
2. You need to be able to fill out weekly updates for the SVP.
3. You need to really want to problem solve.
4. You need to be able to write some and get to know lots of
adminastrators on campus.
5. It is alot of work but alot of fun.

What I would really like is to have Co-Chairs again. Regardless of any
previous communications, please e-mail me and we will talk.

Thanks,
Mattyg (with edits by his Administrative Assistant (NOT Secretary).

	Is there anyone that is interested in going to the New England
Revolution vs. Miami Fusion soccer game tomorrow night?  I have two extra
tickets (in addition to the 20 who are going as a group).  The people
don't necessarily have to be sitting with the group of 20 of us, but we
could work it out if they desired. If you are interested or know of anyone
who is (relatives, friends, etc.) Please contact me ASAP by phone
(770-1807) or email (mjucius@wpi.edu).
	Matt

	For all of you who are going to the New England Revolution game
tomorrow, here is the schedule of events with the times and places
everyone is asking me about.

4:30 Meet in Wedge
5:00 Leave for Foxboro
6:00 Arrive at Foxboro and get free stuff before game
7:30 Beginning of game!!!!!
10:00 end of game :-(
11:00 get home

	If anyone has a car and is willing to drive, PLEASE bring it.  As
of now, I only know of two cars that will be there and that won't hold 20
of us.  Also, if everyone would be so kind as to bring a couple extra buck
to chip in for gas money and parking, that would we wonderful since
parking is $10 a car.  Dress warm because it always seems to be 10 degrees
colder there than it is here.  I can't wait to see everyone tomorrow!!!
	Matt

Hi OIsters,
	Tonight will be a special meeting because we will be unveiling the
super secret big things, and the last pledge class will get their presents
and the seniors will get goodies as well. MattyG  said that he will have a
few presentations also. The meeting will be short and sweet, but I
encourage all of you to come and share in the handing out of good stuff.
See you tonight!
	
YiLFS,
Nila

Hi everyone!

Tonight's meeting will be shorter than most brother meetings, because of
studying and stuff.  However, it is very important for everyone,
especially new brothers to be there.

Hi Everyone!
	Well composites are in and if you are interested in reviewing the
pictures of yourself and more likely helping decide on which one will go
on the APO composite than join us at 12:30 on Thurs. I think that we'll be
in Morgan A or B, and when I find out for sure I'll let you know. 
	YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME. THE PHOTOGRAPHER WILL PICK OUT THE BEST
PICTURE IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT.	NO PROBLEM
	Well, hope that helps- Mike

Mike, just to clarify...
I think you mean the Proofs of the composits are in, not the entire picture
of everyone, I know I was confused at first.....
this is where we get to make sure I don't ruin the entire photo by looking
even worse that I usually do...

HI Everyone!

	I just want to make sure that everyone understood that the
pictures which the photographer has to show are the proofs not the final
product. These are what they make the composite out of.

WE do have a place for sure to meet the photographer to go over the proofs 
The FORKEY CONFERENCE ROOM from 12-2 on 4/30/98. It is in Harrington Aud.
Have a great day!- Mike

Hey 

Sorry to send this to everyone but.
If you are in any of the Dormatories then could you check your floor to
see if it has a box to put food in. If not then while you are strolling
through Daniels could you walk into the basement and grab a box. Just
bring it back ot your building. Ask your RA for a big black marker and
write "End-O-Year Food Drive" On it. Food to be picked up Thursday
afternoon. We will probably knowck on doors too but getting these out will
help out alot. 

Ok that is all.

I am very sorry about abusing the mailing list for this.  I had the list
of only new brothers, but my inbox seems to have eaten it.

If you are not a new brohter, you can delete this now.

Are there any of you who have not done the "special" thing in the
office?  I know I haven't, and I want to get a group of people together
to go over before we leave school.  I am thinking that Thursday
afternoon would be a good time.  It will probably take about an hour to
finish.

Please let me know when you are free, and I'll find a time that's good
for all of us.

YiLFS,
Jen Hardy

What a subject huh?   :)

Since I couldn't make it to any brother meetings this year, I wanted to
write a quick email to everyone before I finally left WPI. (Yeah!)

First off, I want to say congratulations to everyone who's
graduating....good luck with the "real world"!!!!

Secondly, I want to wish all the underclassmen the best of luck with their
stay at WPI and to keep APO running strong.  I have seen the fraternity grow
a lot since I joined (eek...back in '93), and I know it will continue to
grow with the enthusiasm I have seen this year.  Congratulations to the new
brothers....although I don't know many of you,  I guess that'll give me an
excuse to try and stop back from time to time.


And lastly.....

hey y'all,

	i had kinda an idea.  I was wondering if anyone who is graduating, or leaving, or just moving for some reason, and wants to give away some furniture, if they could post it on aponews.  I know that next year, i will be very limited on the furniture that i am bringing to my appartment, and i'm sure some others will be too. If anyone out there has old tables, chairs, desks, or anything that they want to give away, maybe some of us out here might want them.  Of course its just a thought, and if no one wants to, thats cool.

. To extend this message, if there is anyone willing to part with some
furniture, I'm sure there are people willing to buy it as well (I for one
am.)  If you have some furniture that is just too much trouble to lug
around (i.e. couch, etc.) just post it.

If anyone is interested and is going to be in the area.  Next Sunday (the
sun that we are out of school), there is going to be a 20 mile walk in
Boston to raise money for Project Bread.  I've done it for 3 years and it
is great fun.  If you are interested, please email me.  Thanks :)

Hey all,

I have almost all the soda sold off. I just need to get rid of some Diet
Cola. If you like Diet Cola It is 6 bucks for 24 cans. I have about 5
cases left. I think I have a case of Root Beer too. If you want some just
email me. 

THanks,
mattyg

Subject: Chamber Choir!


Hello everyone!

As you may have heard, I will be directing the WPI Chamber Choir next year
(I'm not directing Simple Harmonic Motion).  So here's my pitch to all of
you...I'm looking for women (and men) who would like to sing next year.  I
already have a bunch of guys who are interested, but I am in desparate
need of more female voices (especially altos!!). 

My goal is to take the Chamber Choir in a completely different direction
next year.  My main area of interest is not strictly in gregorian chant or
madrigals (although I do like that style of music).  I'm more interested
in singing as wide a variety of music as humanly possible...and more
contemporary stuff as well.  I'd also like to see the group perform more
often too.  But above all, I want everyone to have fun while producing
some excellent sound...after all, that's the reason why 99% people
sing...for the fun of it! 

Right now I am looking at having at least one 2 hour rehearsal per week
(probably Sunday night).  I would also like to have another rehearsal per
week, but right now I don't know if that is possible given everyone's
schedules.  Obviously, I am looking for people who can (and will) be able
to fully commit to the group, so if you already have several commitments,
you may want to take that into consideration.

SO, I hope you will give this some serious consideration.  I can't
guarantee anything, but I am fairly confident that you will not regret
having joined the Chamber Choir next year.

I know it's kind of short notice, but if you are interested, the current
members and I will be having a brief meeting this afternoon (Thursday) at
4:30 in the JE Room in Alden to discuss the upcoming year.  Please stop by
if you are intersted.  

If you can't make it, but you are still interested in joining, please feel
free to email me back.

I look forward to hearing from you!

--Mike Driscoll

just so nobody shows up for the meeting, it has already taken place.  and
to provide a little more updated information, there are going to be 2
rehearsals each approximately 1 hour a week.

This summer I am going ot attend the Chapter Program Workshop that the
National Office puts on to help develop leadership and chapter building
for APO. There is a little paperwork and the deadline is Friday. So if you
want to go check your previous email from Yusef for dates. 

If you want to sign up email me and i will put the application in your
Mialbox. Then just mail them back to me and I will send them all in at
once.

OK so my deadline is to get them back by friday morning so that I can call
nationals and sign you all up. 

Thanks,

mattyg

Hi guys- there is a problem.  As some of you know, my computer decided to
die this week and crashed via a nasty virus.  In the process I have lost
the scanned pictures.  If there is some reason that you cannot live
without them during the summer, please drop a "selfaddressed stamped
envelope" in my campus mail box (box 1293) and I will send them to you in
the next few weeks.  I unfortunatly will not be able to re-scan ALL of the
pictures bewteen last night and tomorrow morning!  Have a great summer
all!!!

YiLFS,

every year APO celebreates the 4th of July in Washington DC on the mall 
(between the Lincoln and the Washington Memorials) its a really great time
and a good way to meet a heck of a lot of brothers and you get to experience
DC on the 4th of July (and it is an experience of a lifetime for sure).  
if anyone is interested email me privately

	I apologize for the lateness of this message, but it's finals
week!!  During the last Felcom, we discussed plans for some summer
activities.  Here are the ones we discussed in detail:

1. Pool party at Uri's place.  We don't have an exact date, but it's
looking like one of the first couple weekends in July (Not the 4th).

2. Weekend trip to New Hampshire to stay at Mike Bruno's place.  We'd
split up and one group would go hike up Mt. Washington (or a smaller
mountain) and the other group would got to an amusement park.  Both trips
would be day trips and spend the second night back at Mike's place. We
haven't decided on a date or timeframe for this yet.

3. Weekend trip to Lakes in Maine.  Erica and I both have places we could
stay on a lake.  We're also not too far from the ocean and the alway
interesting tourist trap areas.  We would have to do this in August in
order for the water to be warm enough to swim in.

These plans will be solidifying soon and we will be emailing updates.  If
you are interested in these events but will not have email over the
summer, please email me your home address and we will make sure you are
notified.  If anyone needs to contact me over the summer, you can reach me
at 508-868-0032 at any time.

I hope everyone is having a wonderful last day of classes (I know I am).
Thank you all for supporting my during my term as FVP.  I couldn't have
done it without you.

Hey does anybody want to go to the Sectional Picnic?

Douglas State Forest, Douglas, MA 
1998 June 27

I was still thinking of going although I am pretty sure that i am getting
my Wisdom Teeth out that week. (So someone may have to drive me.) Anyway
if you want to go email me. I will try to put together a ride system for
anyone who might want to go. I think there is swiming and that the deal is
bring your own food. But I am not sure. I will tell you all the details if
you are interested. Ok.

Hope summer is as cool for you as it is in this office,

matty"I wish there were a window in here"g

PS sorry to spam. Don't know everyone who is arround.

You want a window? Man are you expectations high...

I'm just happy with a stinkin' door and a send all calls button.

ah peace and quiet to get work done!

Hey Sorry to Spam everyone again but I wanted not to leave people out.

I am going to be going up to Boston for the day or part of it to see the
fire Works from the Esplanade. At the Bottom is the story from Boston.com
I am thinking of leaving from WPI between 8 and 10 (but that's
debateable) and wondering Boston. If you wanna meet or do something tell
me.
Email me if you want to possably hitch a ride with me from Woosta.

If you want to find the MIT chapter of APO on the Esplanade then you will
have to walk along the Charles river side (not the side next to that crazy
road) untill you are dirrectly across from the Barges (that's where they
keeep the fire works). you will find them there waiting since 5:30 in the
moring.

Get there whenever. Bring stuff to eat if you are going to be hanging out
there. (hang out there cause they are an interesting bunch.) I will be in
and out wondering about. Please RSVP to me so that I can warn them that
how many people will be coming to inundate them. 

That is all.

Boston.Com Article about the Pops

The 25th Annual Fourth of July celebration takes place again this year on
the Esplanade, and includes the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra, Keith
Lockhart conducter. 

The event, which begins at 12 p.m. with afternoon entertainment, is free
and open to the public.

The concert starts at 8 p.m., and will culminate with Tchaikovsky's "1812
Overture." As usual, the overture will be accompanied by fireworks,
cannons and church bells. A 30-minute fireworks show, dubbed a
"pyromusical," immediately follows the concert. 

In celebration of the 25th year, Boston's 4th of July has doubled the
number of sound towers used in 1997 to 30, and plans to broadcast the
concert live via four Sony Jumbotron video screens.

If you are one of the millions of people with nothing to do on July
10th then this message is for you.  

The 10th of July is Big's 21st Birthday.  Who is my Big?  
Its Chris Yee.  He is coming up from Virginia in order to celebrate.
And as luck may have it there is also a party planned...

< prerecorded email >

It's this friday night at 66 Fruit St starting at 9:30pm ....there are
directions below for those who don't know where it is.  :) :) If you don't
think you'll be able to make it home, there is plenty of room to spend the
night...(just bring a pillow and sleeping bag)  
	Everyone should bring some kind of alcohol to share.  There will
be some beer available for games (cups, Beirut, card games...ect..)  It'll
be a lot of fun, so everyone should come.. :) :)  and of course bring
friends.. :) :)

Hi Everyone!
	Hope you are all enjoying your summer!
	I'm planning on going hiking up in the white mountains (in New
Hampshire) around the 1st of August. I was wondering if anyone would
like to join Nila and I. My parents said that you are all welcome to
stay over at my house that friday night and then on Saturday we can go
hiking. I also live near a nice lake which we can go swimming in. If you
are interested contact me asap. I will need to know by next Wed how many
of your going to show up. I will provide the necessary details on what
to bring, how to get here etc later. Look forward to hearing from you
and have a great summer!
	                            Mike

Hi all,
We are trying to get a head start on apo paperwork and we need everyone's
help. If everyone could send and email to joehouse@wpi.edu with their
membership number (find it on your membership card) as soon as they can
it would be very helpful.
If you are a member of the fall 97 or spring 98 pledge class, this
message doesn't apply to you because you don't have a card yet, or I
wrote down your numbers already. But everyone else, please try to find
your cards!!

thanks a million, 
see you soon.
Nila

Hello OI!

I *KNOW* everyone (hard to resist the temptation to say "y'all") had a
good summer, right?!  

Please help everyone out by checking out the OI Book
page.  You can get it from the main apo page or 

http://www.wpi.edu/~apo/books.html

Right now the only books listed are mine, so PLEASE email me books you
have and the books you need.  Hopefully someone will have what you want.

Thanks!  

Happy A term :-)

Chris

I know that it is the beginning of the new semester, but the summer can't
be over yet, can it?  It must be a hallucination or mirage or something
else (???).  This whole summer passed by and I did not go to the beach or
to the amusement park.


Well, anyways, anyone interested in a road trip to Canobie Lake park?  I
know that it is small, but it can be fun.  (Especially when you see what
happens to me on the Teacups).  The time is open to negotiation and I
could provide a ride for a few people.  Email me or call me if you are
interested.

2) Service schedule for school year upcoming
3) APO Charity Fundraiser (hint: Big BOX!!)
4) Service POCs needed
5) SerComm Wednesday noon at Gompei's (food!)

6) Big bro signup

13) Can you dance ("Tell me......tell me....HEY! Watch me now! ... ")

14) Conclave chairs needed
15) Sailing....takes me away ... to where I've always heard it could be....

DETAILS:

1) Composites were handed out tonight.  If you missed getting yours, contact Mike.

2) The tentative service schedule will be posted soon.  This is tentative because the 
      brotherhood will be voting on it at the next brother meeting (Sept 14).

3) For Spirit Week, APO will be building a large box to place in the wedge and other
      various places.  Passersby can throw in spare change, and the money will be donated
      to a charity.  
  
   We need someone to build said box.  Matt Grabowski has detailed blueprints (or at least
      that's the word on the street).
   We need someone to paint the box.  It will have a large GOAT on the front.

4) If you would like to chair or coordinate some service projects, contact Matt Grabowski.
   Chairs needed include (but are not limited to):
      Service Auction
      Correspondence for joint project with UNH, UVM, MMA, UMass, MIT after National Service Week
      Blood Drive
      Veterans' Shelter projects
      Boy Scout Weekend

5) Service Committee Wednesday at noon in Gompei's, with pizza provided by the generous SVP.

6) Contact Nila if you would like to be a big brother during this fall.

7) Mustard Seed for OI is on the 13 and 27 of September.  Signup with Matt Grabowski.

8) Rush starts September 14th.  This is also the next brother meeting, so be sure to be there
    to say hi to the prospectives.

9) Also occurring September 14 (the next brother meeting) is advisor voting.  We already have a list,
    but we need to vote formally on advisors.

10) We need flyers and posters, so if you can draw, let Nila know :)

11) FelComm will be held after the brother meetings in Gompei's

12) October 5th is the next potluck dinner.  Details to come soon.

13) The Formal is tentatively scheduled for December 11.

14) Six chairs needed for Conclave bid preparation.  Contact Jen Stauff or Jo Tenczar.  The chairs are:
    Banquet:  Plans the Saturday banquet and that night's schedule
    Registration:  Manages registration database; assembles and distributes info packets
    Food:  Breakfast and Lunch preparations
    Workshops:  Coordinates and schedules the workshops
    Service/Fellowship:  Plans Friday night Fellowship and Saturday Service projects
    Donations:  Begs and pleads to get donations :)

15) Nila's parents have graciously invited OI to go sailing with them during the October break. 
    Ask Nila all your questions about this event.  I don't know anything!  I swear!

Hey Brothers,

I have an awesome oppertunity for you. We've been putting together a
retreat for the brotherhood that has finally come together in the last few
days. So here is the deal. 

We will be leaving Friday Sept. 25 for Camp Split Rock in Ashburmham, MA.
We will get there friday night and stay untill sunday morning.
If you need to leave late or early that can probably be arranged. 
But really cool things happen on Sat so you know you want to be there!

To defray the costs of Food and Lodging we are asking for $8 per person.
That will cover expences for the weekend. 

I promise a great time and a wacky weekend. And you are away from WOOPIE
too! Anyway if you want to go just email me or sign up at the brother
meeting. I will have full details there. 

More to come!

Chris,

Thank you for the APO minutes.  Having these on email is a good reference
for those who were at the meeting, and an update and reminder for those of
us who did not or could not attend.  Looks like an excellent, ambitious
set of activities planned for the year.  I hope to join you for an
upcoming meeting or two.  Were you successful in recruiting other
advisors?

YiLFS,
Wes Mott

hola everyone, 
	Its that time again.  Dance-a-thon!!!!!!!! We're aren't asking for
much, all that we need is people to help.  The more people that volunteer,
the less work there is to go around.  We also need people to co-chair the
committees of publicity, set-up, and logistics.  If you are interested in
either co-chairing or just helping out on a committee, please email me
back as soon as you can.  thanks a lot everyone, and lets make this the
best dance-a-thon yet,

Brad

Tonight! (Wednesday)

I will be in the wedge at 8:00 to meet people and then walk to my
apartment.  If you are coming later, my apartment is in Salisbury Estates,
77 #8.  It is right out front by the flagpole and the rental office.

Also, if you have a movie you want to watch, bring it (DVD or VHS) because
my movie selection isn't as big as Juices'... yet.  If Wed. night doesn't
work out for a lot of people, I am open to changing movie night to any
other night of the week and pretty much any time!

See ya tonight!

Hey Brothers,
I have some info for you on the retreat.
Ok here's the basic jist of what is planned.

Friday, Get up there. Convine arround 9:00 for a little info on a service
project the next day. Then fellowship type stuff.

Sat.  Morning is a Service project that I cannot disclose at this time. 
(It;s a surprise!)
      Afternoon is some time to hike, run, play, do whatever. (maybe even
Homework if that's your fancy.)
      Evening is Dinner and then some cool games and a little discussion.
Followed by the mystery event.

Sunday Morning is up early and cleanup of hte cabins. Breakfast and then
we are off for Woopi. 

That's the jist. Some fun, some work, and some more fun. All BROTHERHOOD!

But I need some people to commit to going. So I need:
$8 in an envelope in my box #438. or hand delivered to me.
I need the money by Monday's meeting. No later.

We will carpool up there and back. I will try to put people who need to
leave at special times with people who can go at those times. 

If youhave questions just email me.

Thanks,
mattyg

Hey!  After careful review of the sign up sheet for people to work on
conclave, I came to one definite conclusion - we need more people to be
willing to work on this.  So, for anyone who wasn't at the meeting or
anyone who has had some major life changing experience and now wants to
devote some time to this, here's another chance to let Jen and I know that
you're ready to work for this.  We need committee chais and people to work
on the following committees:

service project/fellowship project
workshops
food (everything except the banquet)
banquet
dance
registration
correspondence/publicity
donations

Everyone who has signed up so far has been for registration, banquet and
dance.  Keep that in mind and really consider the other committtees.  The
other ones will be fun too!  And if anyone who already signed up is
willing to work on another committee, let me know.

E-mail me back ASAP with what you'd like to help out with.  Thanks.  =)

YiLFS,
Jo

A question was brought up and yes, official duties such as giving a campus
tour for the admissions office, or while answering a call for ems is also
off limits.  Sorry I didn't think of those things guys.  I also forgot to
mention please email me when you make a kill, so I make sure that you have
recieved the correct next victem and so we know when we have a winner.
Happy "killing"!

Ok guys, I'm not very good at this kind of stuff, so I left out a few more
things..FIrst ther are NO items of protection in our version, we want it
to end some time in the next century or two.  Second, the service project
this weekend and all other committee meetings, fellowship events, ect are
off from 10 minutes before hand so people don't just stand outside the dor
waiting.  You kill your target by sticking your sticker (which you
provide) on the armand/or back of your target.  Any other questions let me
know!

I normally wouldn't  use the apo alias for something like this, but I am
really in a crunch.  I need to get rid of my futon before monday.  I am
not looking for much money, and any offer (somewhat reasonable) will be
seriously considered.  If you are interested in picking up a very sturdy
and strong futon at a good price, let me know.  Phone would be the best
way to get a hold of me, but email is ok.........

HI everyone,
	I'd like to remind everyone that we have an amazing fun service
opportunity this weekend. We will meet on saturday at 9am on the seal to
go clean up the park across from elm street park. WE'll quit around noon. 
On sunday we'll meet in the wedge at 1pm and work until about 4pm. So i'd
like to encourage everyone to try to make at least one of these
opportunities and have a good turn out for RUSH! 
 
YILFS,
Nila

HI EVERYONE!
	I'm writing to ask for you support in this weekends park clean up.
I know that you can appreciate how important it is for APO to have a
strong showing of our brotherhood at an event open to perspectives. I
would consider you attendance key to showing how strong and alive our
chapter is. Please make every effort to attend at least one of the park
clean ups during this weekend.

	Also we will be having our first retreat Next Weekend. I know that
email has been sent to remind you and I would like to add to that reminder
by urging you all to make the effort to attend. The times are flexible and
with a little effort from each of us, I am sure that we can all have a
fabulous weekend.

	Thanks and have a great weekend- Mike

HI we have people signed up for our pledge class.
16 so far, but we still have time.
Important!!!  IMPORTANT!!! IMPORTANT!!! READ THIS PART.
  
Inductions will be Thursday at 6:00pm and Friday at 7:30pm for sure.

 At the next brother meeting, I will cancel the Tuesday 6:00pm induction
because it seems that it's not a good time for people. IF on the other
hand, cancelling the tuesday induction would prevent people from coming, I
will not cancel it.  Please email me if you want me to keep the tuesday
induction. We will discuss further at the next brother meeting. Thanks for
putting up with this flood.

Hey, People.  The purpose of this message is to notify you all of an event
that is occurring this weekend.  It is called the Mountain of Hope and it
is occuring at Wachusett Mountain.  It is a benefit for Spectrum Health
Systems, which runs the Spectrum House in Westboro.  It basically involves
getting pledges and then just enjoying a day at the mountain.  Activities
include hiking, mountain biking among other outdoor activities.  The
Spectrum House is a residential drug abuse rehabilitation program.  If
anyone is interested, email me and I will get you some info.  Sorry for
the short notice.

Peace.

	Sorry for missing the Monday Meeting, but I will have a contest
next week, so sharpen your minds and be ready to win...more details on
Monday!  In the meantime, here's a funny one somebody sent me...  I didn't
even type it in, just cut and pasted for those of you who almost pinned me
for vulgarity.  It actually caused me to chuckle...so here you are:

A businessman got on an elevator in a building.  When he entered
 the elevator, there was a blonde already inside and she
 greeted him by saying, "T-G-I-F."

 He smiled at her and replied, "S-H-I-T."

 She looked at him puzzled, and said, "T-G-I-F," again. He acknowledged
her remark again by answering, "S-H-I-T."

 The blond was trying to be friendly, so she smiled her biggest smile nd

 said as sweetly as possibly, "T-G-I-F," another time.

 The man smiled back to her and once again replied with a quizzical
 expression, "S-H-I-T."

 The blond finally decided to explain things, and this time she said,
 "T-G-I-F, Thank Goodness It's Friday, get it?"

 The man answered, "Sorry, Honey, It's Thursday."

Hi everyone,

I'm the Communcations Coordinator for Section 96
of Alpha Phi Omega (Southern New England).

You are receiving this note (possibly multiple
times) because you are reading mail addressed to 
a chapter of Alphi Phi Omega in this section;
you are president of a chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega in this section, you are on a distribution
list for a chapter of Alpha Phi Omega in this
section, or you are advisor to a chapter of
Alpha Phi Omega in this section.

There may be some redundancy. I apologize; I would
rather err on the side of communicating too much
than too litle.

You will be receiving future broadcasts of
information, requests for help, and other such
Sectional stuff from myself or the other two
members of the new Communications Committee as
they come in, unless you specify to the committee
[myself, Brian Lakin (civeng@juno.com), and
Stephanie Weintraub (tweets@gis.net)] that you
do not wish to receive future broadcasts.

This note is from Chad Eckert, President of Epsilon
Delta Chapter (via Steve Goldsmith). Chad's # is
860-667-4873; his e-mail is ceckert502@aol.com.
Please contact him directly if you can help out.

Sharon Zohar
Section 96 Communication Coordinator

Hi Steve,

If you could get brothers for any of the Rush events,
that would be great!! Also if you could get some for
rush tables that would also be great.. The rush
tables are:
    -Tuesday, Oct. 29 from 9-12:30 
	{forwarder's note: maybe September?}
    -Wednesday, Oct. 30,  9-2 
	{forwarder's note: maybe September?}
    -Monday, Oct. 5,  9-2
    -Tuesday, Oct. 6,   9-12:30
    -Monday, Oct. 12,   9-12
    -Tuesday Oct. 13,   9-12:30

Some of the 12:30 days may go longer.  It depends on
some of the brothers here.

Hello brothers,
  My name is Chad Eckert, President of Epsilon Delta.  The letter that was
sent to you didn't include the rush dates.  The rushes are Oct. 1-Pizza and
bowling, Oct. 5-Downtown Hartford trip, and Oct. 13-either haunted hayride or
haunted house.  All rushes meet in the student center at 7:30.  Please feel
free to call me if you can come, or have any questions.

                                                            Thanks,
                                                                   Chad

Sorry to abuse the list, but Dani has put a lot of real hard work into
this and I thought a few of you guys might be interested.  It certainly
goes along with the whole, APO means spirit/pride for the
community/school.  From what she explained in my leadership class, it's
just running around at games, painting your face in school colors, and
they even have a new school chant!  Email her with any other questions!

YiLFS,

Okay, if you are receiving this e-mail, it is because either I know you,
or I know someone who knows you.  Point is I am trying to create more
school spirit at WPI.  ...and I need help.  I am trying to start a club
where we would basically go to Sports events, and other things and show
support for our friends.  This is going to take a lot of people who want
to have a lot of fun, and be obnoxious.  I am having a meeting at 4:45 in
Harrington Auditorium, on Tuesday Sept. 29.  We have an advisor, we just
need people to support it so that way the school will give us money for
free pizza, sweatshirts, t-shirts, noise makers...and a GOAT COSTUME!
So...I need at least 50 people to come to the meeting so that I can have
signatures saying "I support this idea for a club...blah blah blah" 
If you can't make it, but would like to be on the e-mail list, just write
to me.  Please forward this to people who you think might be interested.
AND...I don't know any freshman, so if you do, please pass this along to
them. This can be a lot of fun, so go to the meeting for more info!

Thanks!
Dani

P.S.  I am going to be looking for officers...anyone need a leadership
role????

Hey everyone,

Hey Heather Sheldon is working out the details of a FacePainting booth at
Home Coming. So here's the deal. If you would like to help paint faces
anytime from 11 to 2 that would be spectacular. We need like 2 people to
sit at the booth at any given time. 

So here is the Deal

11:00 to 12:00   1.		2.
12:00 to 1:00	 1.		2.
1:00 to 2:00	 1.		2.

Please reply to only me. 

Thanks,
mattyg

Hi Everyone!
	Well this weekend is just jammed packed with stuff to do and so I
want to remind everyone that APO is having a killer bar-B-que on Sat. All
brothers and pledges are invited. It's a great chance to meet up with some
APO alumni, not to mention current Brothers too! I would like to
especially invite all those poor souls suffering through ID 2050, -we miss
you guys and gals, and this would be a great chance to see you all as well
as introduce you to our new pledge class!
	So come on down to olin hall at 12:00 on Sat. Can't wait to see
you all there!

also those who have already paid me for conclave, I just have one other
question:

KO is running a LEAP session at this conclave, It is a leadership workshop
that lasts most of saturday (so choosing this would mean not being able to
attend any other workshops).  It is a GREAT way to meet other people, and to
build leadership skills!  If you want to attend, we need to pre-register you
for it, so please let me know, I'll be attaching the little blub they have
about it at the end of this message!  IT is a limited workshop, so the
quicker you answer the better!

--joe

LEAP workshop:
-Learn leadership skills in Team building, presentation skills, goal setting
skills, analyzing skills, and more!

	Maybe I missed something but this is the first it's been mentioned that
there is an alumni barbecue on this date (and only an aside at that).
Unfortunately 1 day (something like 23 hours and 40 minutes actually) notice
is not enough time to change plans to be there. So have a good barbecue and
maybe next time with some more warning I'll be able to get there...

Far be it from me to ever pass up free food.
Especially bobby-Q....

But the 1500 mile commute would be kinda hard....

Hi John,

Long time no see!

>is not enough time to change plans to be there. So have a good barbecue and
>maybe next time with some more warning I'll be able to get there...

Don't have a cow, man!  I get the impression that this is not really an
official alumni barbeque.  Sounds like OI was planning a barbeque for
Saturday, and this weekend just happens to be Homecoming weekend.  If any
OI alumni happen to stumble on by, then they're welcome to participate.
Right?  But I agree, an official invition would have been nice just the
same.  We're not all on aponews. :-)

I do propose that we plan an alumni event, if not this year sometime, then
maybe for next year's Homecoming.  I'd love to meet the new crew.

Sorry to clutter up aponews with this drivel!

Regards,
Marc

>Long time no see!

not since that time we had dinner in Nashua...

*blurbage deleted*

>Don't have a cow, man!

eh? wasn't intending to... but possibly I was a little short and terse...
sorry Mike, wasn't intending to slam yah :)
social graces? what are those? I'm an engineer ;)

>I do propose that we plan an alumni event, if not this year sometime, then

Next year actually is the 35th anniversary of the chartering. December, 19th
1964. It would be most cool if we could do
something for it :) And maybe this time we could do some sort of alumni
association... so people can track each other
over the years and the miles, and take a bit of the load of contacting
people off the chapter... and we could also be
around as a resource for the undergraduates. Funniest thing is I actually
ran into one of WPI's charters at an APO event
down in New Jersey and learned a lot of interesting things about the early
days... I get to go to all these things since
I'm the section chair for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Quebec

>Sorry to clutter up aponews with this drivel!

I wasn't going to clutter APOnews anymore... but I figured that I'd make
sure ya'll didn't think this alumni was slamming Bruno out of the blue. My
words having been a little harsher than I'd intended. Plus I figured I'd
also throw the idea of an alumni association out there and see if it
sprouted wings of it's own...

Hi everyone,
	Tommorrow at the potluck brother meeting in AK322, bigs and
littles will be introduced. 
	I tried really hard to accomodate everyone's
wishes in this program but their were more possible bigs than littles, so
we simply matched what people said they were looking for with what was on
the sheets you filled out. i still need someone to chair a big little
events committee or do the planning for the events with the help of the
rest of memcomm. if interested please say so. 
after the brother meeting, pledges will stick around for some time to get
to know their own pledge class. 
YiLFS,

Boys, boys, boys... be nice now!  If you'd REALLY been paying attention
to aponews, you would have seen the message about the barbeque about
two weeks before it happened... something along the lines of "We're
having a barbeque homecoming weekend, and we were thinking about
inviting all the alumni, since it is homecoming and all." Or something
like that. Honest-to-god, it was a solid two weeks! :-)   (it was
actually the only thing that made me seriously consider going to
homecoming, because spending all my days in Worcester now-a-days
has reminded me that I'd love to be more involved with the chapter
again, or at least convince 'em all to give platelets!)

Anyway, had to clear that up, and defend the old chapter - there
WAS advance notice!  *grin*

	I would like to thank everyone for coming to the homecomming BBQ.  I
considered it a HUGE success.  We estimated there were somewhere
around 40 pledges, brothers, and alumni that showed up at one time or
another.  The best part was that we had absolutely no leftover food. 
I hope everyone had as much fun as I did.  I hope we can make this a
regular event in the future.  Thanks again.
	Matt

P.S.  I appreciate all the feedback from the alumni.  If you have more
comment, suggestions, concerns, or ideas for alumni events, please
contact me directly at mjucius@mediaone.net.

I saw that one... asked people in the chapter about it, they said
I don't know *shrugged shoulders* (over email too... there good!)
eh.... oh well... I couldn't have gone anyways... I was crewing the
S.S. Bowdoin out of Castine this weekend... can't be off Vinalhaven
and in Worcester :( But on that score none of our Girl Scouts got
sick... so I did not have to swab the deck... :)

What no more coffee breaks in Cambridge Park?

I think over the last two days that's been a general consensus, and
it looks like Matt Jucius is going to run with it...

you know I still do that... it's how I end up watching movies most
days :)

you know it's half humourus, I'm complained about lack of notice and
stuff, and that's so reverse from five years ago... *wink grin* me
WAGnav? NEVER....

back to pushing the electrons around... and let me push them away from
aponews...

I emailed everyone not present at the brother meeting tonight the names of
their big or little. If you still don't know who you are paired with, let
me know asap. If your big hasn't at least said hi by the end of the week,
let me know so I can make sure that they knew they were a big.

Folks---

	One last alumni posting... and this is geared to the other lurkers from the
past on aponews...

Considering all the discussions over the last three days about the stuff
Matt Jucius brought up...
Alumni Associations and such... I've created an alumni mailing list to
further the discussion on
setting up an official spiffy alumni association... Matt needs our help to
get it done :)

You might say, well I'm a sophomore on the five year plan, why do *I* care?
Well here's some reasons
for getting an alumni association up off the ground

* It's a way to keep in touch with your brothers over the years and miles
after graduation

* For you the graduating senior, it's a great way to begin the job hunt. We
"the alumni"
work for companies like; GTE, Compaq, Cabletron, Hitachi, Wyman-Gordon,
Norton Co, etc.
Advice and words of warning can be infinitely helpful. Internships? I think
that's something
any student would want...

* It's a support mechanism for the chapter. Does the chapter need help with
a big service?
Does the chapter need dollars to avert some crisis?

* Also, did you truly think because you graduated that you were going to be
able to stop
doing service? *go service!*

* Planning for the 35th anniversary of Omicron Iota Chapter (12/18/99!) A
Celebration of
what 700+ people have done for themselves, WPI, and Worcester over the last
35 years.

So if your an alumni, or soon to be alum here's the list:

apo-alums@alum.wpi.edu

to subscribe mail to:

majordomo@alum.wpi.edu

no subject header

body of message:
subscribe apo-alums

and that's it!

I'd also ask that you forward this on to other alums who you know, who might
be
interested! The more of you all who give Matt a hand the more will end up
getting
done and the less of a burden on any one person. And sooner or later...
we'll be
in touch with every person who ever became a brother here at WPI...

for all not interested, please go to Conclave 'cause it's going to be a
rocking
good time :) (that way this message has a point applicable to everyone!)

	Hello To ALL!

	As you may recall, I have reserved Riley Commons for the BENEFIT
CONCERT to be held on APRIL 23rd and/or APRIL 24th.  For those of you who
are not yet aware, this is in fulfillment of my Music Minor Capstone
requirement.

	Just mark your calendars clear!  We want this to be a *huge*
event, and your help is *very* needed!  So what do we need help with??

	*Publicity -- people gotta know about this in many ways.  This
	includes more than just fliers and posters; this includes radio,
	TV, newspapers (on campus, other campuses, city, state, national,
	and so on...) before and after the event.  Why?? Because we want
	it to be possible to have this event in the future, and the way to 
	do that is to make WPI look cool!
		Publicity also includes lining up opportunities to talk
	with others about what is happening, and even performing samples
	of what we sing/do.  Also included is finding opportunites for us
	to do charity work musically outside of this one concert.  All
	this extra effort will lead to a kick butt charity concert because
	everyone and his dog will know about it and want to be there for 
	sooooo many reasons! 8-)

	*Logistics -- as you can already see, there are a lot of logistics
	to putting something of this scale together!!  From the concert
	details (such as getting help from L&L or other such organizations
	to booking plant services to set-up X chairs to helping us choose 
	which groups, songs, acts will be performed, to dealing with
	financial issues that will arise).  The more help I get in this
	arena, the more I can concentrate on the musical aspect of the
	event! 

	*Artists -- do you like to perform, play an instrument, sing, be 
	funny, etc?  The idea of this show is that it is ALL ORIGINAL
	stuff!  I have envisioned mostly musical performances, but if you 
	have other ideas, let me know, and maybe we can incorporate it
	into our game plan.  A juggler in Gompei's during intermission
	could be really cool!

	*Legpeople -- this is a very important one; you have a car?  Can
	you help us get to point b if we need to?  Are you willing to do 
	a few small errands and running around?  The more legpeople, the 
	lighter the load on all and the less stressed out any of us will
	be.

	So these are the main themes of the needs of our project.  If you
have any other ideas for needs, let me know.

	WHAT TO DO NOW:

	Okay, what *you* need to do is choose one or more of the themes
above you would be interesting in helping us with.  Understand that a) you
don't have to be able to make it to the concert to participate in the
preparation!!!  b) the more that commit themselves, the less work for
each!!! c) if you say you will do something, follow through.  We will
cater the work load of each individual to the availible time each of you
have! d) your time and energy *do* count as service hours! e) I *need*
you!! 8-)

	So, please reply letting me know which theme(s) you would like to
focus on and I will keep you posted on the goings on!!

	YiLFS,
	Your Grateful OIster,
	Gabe 8-)

Don't forget about Volleyball tonight from 8-9 in Harrington!  It will be
a good stress relief, believe me!  So whether you are swamped with work or
not, come on down and I guarantee that the hour will do you tons of good! 

By the way, does anyone have a volleyball that they could bring?

Attention bigs and littles!  There are a few brothers and pledgwes
involved in fall sports teams, and they will be having some home games in
the future.  Not only can you support fellow APOers, but you can go as a
big/little bonding experience.  Two for the price of one - you can't beat
that!  Pledge Amy Matter and brother Jen Marinello play volleyball (and
I'm the manager) and the Worcester City Volleyball tournament is going to
be this Saturday in Harrington.  Also, brothers Leslie Chamberlain and
Jenn Patoulidis play soccer, and have a game Thursday.  If anyone else
plays a fall sport, sorry, these are the ones I know of.

know..

<forwarded UNH Message>

    Hey there fellow APO-ers!  I am Allison, the membership/fellowship VP from
the Theta Zeta chapter at UNH and I would like to invite you to a weekend
of fellowship and service at Camp Birch Hill!  Our chapter did this last
year and it was so spectacular, we would like to open this up to the
brothers around New England.  Camp Birch Hill is a summer camp in NH, and
our service to the camp includes painting cabins, cleaning up the camp
areas, picking up tree limbs, etc from the winter storms.... there is
plenty of work to choose from and we won't force you into any particular
activity.
This camping excursion will be held on Sat., April 17 and Sun, April 18th.
We would be leaving UNH around 830 or 9 to get to the camp at 10 am.  We
would take a short tour of the camp, get ourselves settled, and do a great
day of outdoor service.  We may even get to use canoes!  Saturday night, we
will gather around the campfire in the Circle of the Pines, roast some
marshmallows, make s'mores, tell scary stories, and play a great game of
"Psychiatrist" (if you have never played it and don't know how... it's a
lot of fun, we'll show you how to play!)  Sunday morning we'll get up and
have the option to do a few more hours of service, or just eat breakfast,
chat, and then hit the road.  We will be out of Birch Hill by 1 pm on
Sunday afternoon.
This is a summer camp, so we will be staying in cabins.  They are not
heated or particularly weather-proofed for cold nights.  Everyone needs to
bring a sleeping bag (or similar sleeping material in which to bundle),
clothes to get grubby in, appropriate layers for whatever the temperature
may be that weekend, guitars and/or any other campfire activities, any
toiletries, etc.  We will have limited numbers of showers available (last
year, we didn't have ANY running water, so this is a definite
improvement!!)  Food will be purchased by Theta Zeta... so anyone
interested in going, we are asking you to help cover the cost.  Right now,
the estimate is $5 per person, but depending on how many people attend,
this may change.  Please inform your chapters of this great activity!
Please RSVP by Monday, April 12th.  If you have any questions, please
email me at apj@hopper.unh.edu, or call the Theta Zeta office at
603-862-2096 and leave a message.

In L, F, & S,
Allison Jordan, Theta Zeta Membership/Fellowship VP




Never stick your head in a bag full of angry squirrels.

Happiness is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it will elude you. But if you turn your attention to other things, it comes and softly sits on your shoulder. -Nathaniel Hawthorne
