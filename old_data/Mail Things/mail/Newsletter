Lasigna night!!! It starts at 5:30 pm and the cost I belive has been raised to
$4.00 please bring $4.00 and if it is less we will give you back some.

The Servant Auction was a GREAT BIG SUCCESS once again... If you sold yourself
I would like to personaly thank you for helping out (fill-in-the-blank)
charity. I myself didn't get enough courage to stand up there, for fear of only
getting $.50 or something... maybe next year :)

Worcester Childern's Society will be adspecting us there this Saturday at 11am.
 People who are intrested in going and signed Jeff's list please show up at
10:30 in the wedge!!
I'n addition people wanted to do the mustard seed it is this sunday!  Same time
same place (11am I believe in the wedge)  please get intouch with Jeff if you
want to help out at the soup kitchen.

PICTURES!!! WEE!!! Monday the 28th from 1:30-3pm  remeber your time? I do!!!

and wait for a spot :)

Hm, I more thing for after vacation!!!  December 7th, is the Hockey game at the
Centrum, the ticket costs are $8, see John Grossi for more information.  Game
time is at 7:35 pm.   I know these are good prices, my floor is going and they
were only able to get tickets at $10 a piece..

Contest:  Ok, I am going to start a little story and then give a few things
that you MUST include in your addition to my story...  I would like you to
then mail your addition to the story to me so that I can make sure that it is
legal and qualifies, and I will print them out and bring them to the next
brother meeting.


	Upon rolling out of bed on that cold monday morning, I glanced about my
bedroom  and noticed the whole room spinning.   I rub my forehead with my right
hand and look at it.   It's glitening now with sweat.   "Wow, I must of had
some crazy night lastnight!", I think to myself.   I wander to the bathroom and
splash cold water on my face grab a towel and head for the shower.   While in
the shower thoughts start creeping back into my head reguarding what actualy
happened last night.


That's it.. now I want you to use these words/phrases in the contexts of the
story.   Please keep it quasi-respectable(ie. if you don't want to read it at
the brother meeting then it isn't respectable).

			Mike Doherty
			spike the dog
			The roof
			lawnmower
			toothpaste
			laytex

Here's the scoop:
=============================================================================
                               MEETING
=============================================================================
Yes, it's that time of year again, MEETING time....  This Monday at 6:30 
SHARP!!!! in Goddard Hall (Chem building) room 227.  This is where 
meetings were held last spring.  We have the room for C & D terms (soon 
for A & B as well..). 
Let's all show up EARLY....

***************************** NEWSFLASH *************************************
We are now on APO-Savings-Time :)  Due to circumstances fully under our 
control, APO time has been rescheduled to the half hour BEFORE AND/OR 
AFTER events..... We don't appologize for the inconvenience....

Let's try to keep the meetings going smoothly by cutting down the talking 
& especially the "cutting down" (think brotherhood)

CPPC went EXCELLENT!!!!!! If you missed it... you missed it... we had a
great time and accomplished alot.  Many hot topics concerning the chapter
were discussed, including pledging, officers, communication & others.  A
summary should be available soon.  Don't forget to get & fill out the
survey from Dave, we need everyone's input. 

Officers, remember Officer's meeting is MONDAY at 6:00pm in Goddard 227 
(same place as bro. meeting)

Anyone up for a trip to Boston University on Tuesday evening???? John 
Grassi is planning a trip to advertise Spring conclave (remember WE are 
holding conclave the last weekend of spring break.....)  John NEEDS 
drivers/vehicles as well as enthusiastic members to go with him.  John 
said he'd like to leave around 5 (depending on drivers' preferences...) 
BU's brother meeting starts at 8 (I think). John is also planning 
additional trips to other chapters around New England.
contact qasama@banach.wpi.edu for info

RUSH is (tentatively) scheduled for Monday Jan 30 & Thursday Feb 2 (Yes 
we have school Feb 2nd, make sure to mark your calendars)  Corinne is 
going to need people to help with RUSH activities and events.  Everyone's 
help will be needed to distribute flyers & such.

Sorry this newsletter is so long, but people said they wanted to know 
what was going on.....

Brian

Humor:  "System Crash"
-----
                (to "The Caissons Go Rolling Along")
Scratch the disks, dump the core,       Shut it down, pull the plug
Roll the tapes across the floor,        Give the core an extra tug
And the system is going to crash.       And the system is going to crash.
Teletypes smashed to bits.              Mem'ry cards, one and all,
Give the scopes some nasty hits         Toss out halfway down the hall
And the system is going to crash.       And the system is going to crash.
And we've also found                    Just flip one switch
When you turn the power down,           And the lights will cease to twitch
You turn the disk readers into trash.   And the tape drives will crumble
                                                in a flash.
Oh, it's so much fun,                   When the CPU
Now the CPU won't run                   Can print nothing out but "foo,"
And the system is going to crash.       The system is going to crash.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems that this old couple are having trouble remembering things, so
they sign up for a memory course. The course is wonderful; they come
home and tell all their relatives, friends, and neighbors about it.
Some months later, a neighbor approaches the man as he tends the
garden.

Neighbor: Say, Ed, what was the name of the instructor of that memory
course you liked so much?

Ed: Well, it was...hmmm...let me think a minute...

    What's the name of that flower, you know, the one that smells so
    nice, but has thorns on the stems...?

Neighbor: You mean a rose?

Ed: Yeah, that's it...(shouting toward house) Hey, Rose, what was the
memory course instructor's name?

begin joke:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A computer programmer happens across a frog in the road.  The frog
pipes up, "I'm really a beautiful princess and if you kiss me, I'll
stay with you for a week".  The programmer shrugs his sholders and puts
the frog in his pocket.

A few minutes later, the frog says "OK, OK, if you kiss me, I'll give
you a great time for a week".  The programmer nods and puts the frog back
in his pocket.

A few minutes later, "Turn me back into a princess and I'll give you a
great time for a whole year!".  The programmer smiles and walks on.

Finally, the frog says, "What's wrong with you?  I've promised you a
great time for a year from a beautiful princess and you won't even kiss
a frog?"  "I'm a programmer," he replies.  "I don't have time for a great
time....  But a talking frog is pretty neat."

Twas Fortran.....

                OUTCONERR
Twas FORTRAN as the doloop goes
        Did logzerneg the ifthen block
All kludgy were the function flows
        And subroutines adhoc.

Beware the runtime-bug my friend
        squrooneg, the false goto
Beware the infiniteloop
        And shun the inprectoo.

And now, the Motorcycle Joke ][ :
=================================

One unfortunate evening, Jack got into a severe motorcycle injury. After
coming to consciousness on the hospital bed, he looked up to see a doctor.
"Well, Jack" he said, "I have good news, and I have bad news. The bad news
is, because of your injury, we'll have to amputate both of your feet."
Jack was in horror! The doctor added "But the good news is the man in the
bed next to you would like to buy your boots."

Hi and welcome back from summer break.  Hope everyone had a good summer.
We've already had our first brother meeting and our first officer meeting 
of the year, so i suppose the welcome back is a little belated.. 
A few things to remember:

Brother Meeting:
 Monday's at 6 pm (not 6:30 or 6:05..) in Goddard Hall 227

Yes we will be having one on Labor Day...

Officer Meeting:
 Wednesday at 7 pm in Gompei's Function Room

Don't forget about the other meetings, i.e. Service Com., Membership Com., 
 Fellowship Com, Constitution Com., etc....

Also, please send your new information (e-mail, WPI Box #, Tel. #, 
Address/Room #, shoe size) to our Fellowship VP Ben Fisk (benny@wpi.edu).
He will then make up a phone tree and also forward the info to me so I 
can print up a brother list.

That should be all for now,
YiLFS
