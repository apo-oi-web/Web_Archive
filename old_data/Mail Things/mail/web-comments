Message: To Whom it May Concern:

My name is Bridget Curtis, I am a graduate of WPI's Certificate Program
in Unix/C,C++ program and Client/Server Programming.  I am writing
this email to ask for voluneers from WPI, who can help me with
a computer training program that I have started in Worcester for
a homeless women's shelter. Sigourney Street shelter and Faith House,
which is a half-way house. Both shelters are for women and their
children.  I need volunteers who can help me teach intro. to
computers and Microsoft Word.  I need volunteers to teach once
a week, they can volunteer to teach once a month or twice a month.
My classes are for one hour during the week.  They can teach either
on Tuesdays or Thursdays.  
I would appreciate any assistance you may offer in this most
important project.  

Thank You,
Bridget Curtis
